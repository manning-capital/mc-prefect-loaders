        "BODY": "BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury: DV8’s Bold Move to Transform Southeast Asia’s Crypto Landscape In a groundbreaking announcement that sent ripples across the Asian financial landscape, Thai-listed company DV8 revealed its audacious plan to become Southeast Asia’s first dedicated Bitcoin treasury firm. This strategic pivot, fueled by a successful 241 million baht (approximately $7.4 million) capital raise, marks a significant milestone in the mainstream adoption of digital assets within the region. For investors and enthusiasts alike, this move signals a new era where traditional companies are increasingly recognizing the transformative potential of Bitcoin as a core treasury asset. What Exactly is a Bitcoin Treasury , and Why Now? At its core, a Bitcoin treasury strategy involves a company holding a significant portion of its corporate reserves in Bitcoin, rather than solely in traditional fiat currencies or conventional assets. This concept gained considerable traction following MicroStrategy’s pioneering adoption, which saw the business intelligence firm accumulate vast amounts of Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. The rationale behind such a move is multi-faceted: Inflation Hedge: In an era of increasing quantitative easing and inflationary concerns, Bitcoin’s fixed supply cap of 21 million coins positions it as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Digital Gold Narrative: Often referred to as ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin shares characteristics with traditional safe-haven assets, offering a decentralized and censorship-resistant store of value. Long-Term Value Appreciation: Proponents believe Bitcoin’s fundamental properties and growing network effect will lead to significant long-term capital appreciation, enhancing corporate balance sheets. Market Leadership: Being an early mover in this space can signal innovation and attract a new class of forward-thinking investors. DV8’s decision underscores a growing global trend where corporations are exploring alternatives to traditional cash management strategies, seeking to optimize their balance sheets in a rapidly evolving economic climate. DV8 ‘s Ambitious Vision: Emulating the Giants The news, initially reported by Odaily, highlights DV8’s clear intention to follow in the footsteps of companies like MicroStrategy. The Thai firm’s 241 million baht raise provides the foundational capital for this transformation. But what exactly does this mean for DV8? By transforming into a ‘cryptocurrency reserve company,’ DV8 aims to: Acquire and Hold Bitcoin: The primary objective will be to purchase and securely hold Bitcoin as a significant portion of its treasury assets. Boost Shareholder Value: This is the ultimate goal. By leveraging Bitcoin’s potential for appreciation, DV8 hopes to significantly enhance its financial position and, consequently, the value for its shareholders. Set a Precedent: As the first of its kind in Southeast Asia, DV8 is positioning itself as a pioneer, potentially inspiring other regional companies to explore similar strategies. This bold move by DV8 is not just about holding Bitcoin; it’s about fundamentally re-evaluating traditional corporate finance in the digital age. Pioneering the Path for Southeast Asia Crypto Adoption DV8’s pivot carries immense significance for the broader Southeast Asia crypto landscape. The region, known for its dynamic economies and tech-savvy population, has shown increasing interest in digital assets, but corporate adoption at this scale has been relatively limited. DV8’s initiative could serve as a powerful catalyst: Increased Legitimacy: A publicly listed company embracing Bitcoin as a treasury asset lends significant credibility to the cryptocurrency space within the region. Regulatory Dialogue: Such high-profile moves often spur clearer regulatory frameworks, which are crucial for sustainable growth and broader institutional participation. Regional Inspiration: Other companies in Thailand and neighboring countries like Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam might observe DV8’s performance closely, potentially leading to a domino effect of corporate Bitcoin adoption. Investment Hub: This could further cement Southeast Asia’s reputation as a growing hub for blockchain innovation and cryptocurrency investment. The move by DV8 could be the spark that ignites a new wave of corporate interest in digital assets across one of the world’s most vibrant economic regions. The MicroStrategy Model : A Blueprint for Corporate Bitcoin Holdings When DV8 explicitly states its inspiration from MicroStrategy, it’s worth examining what this MicroStrategy model entails. Led by its outspoken CEO Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy began acquiring Bitcoin in August 2020, citing concerns over inflation and the long-term depreciation of fiat currencies. Their strategy has been characterized by: Aggressive Accumulation: MicroStrategy has consistently added Bitcoin to its balance sheet, often through debt financing or equity raises. Long-Term HODL: The company views Bitcoin as a long-term strategic asset, not a short-term trading vehicle. Public Advocacy: Saylor has become a prominent advocate for corporate Bitcoin adoption, educating other companies and investors on its benefits. While the MicroStrategy model has been highly successful in terms of Bitcoin accumulation and attracting market attention, it also comes with inherent risks, primarily related to Bitcoin’s price volatility. DV8 will undoubtedly face similar considerations, navigating market fluctuations while maintaining its long-term vision. Key Differences and Similarities: DV8 vs. MicroStrategy While inspired, DV8’s approach might not be an exact replica. Here’s a quick comparison: Feature MicroStrategy (MSTR) DV8 (Thailand) Primary Business Business Intelligence Software Initially Media & Entertainment; Transforming to Crypto Reserve Treasury Size Billions of USD in Bitcoin Starting with $7.4M raise Geographic Focus Global (US-based) Southeast Asia (Thailand-based) Goal Maximize long-term shareholder value through Bitcoin acquisition Boost shareholder value by transforming into a crypto reserve company DV8’s initial capital raise of $7.4 million is a modest start compared to MicroStrategy’s multi-billion dollar holdings, but it represents a significant commitment for a company of its size and region. How This Move Aims to Boost Shareholder Value The core motivation for DV8’s strategic shift is clear: to enhance shareholder value . This isn’t merely a speculative gamble; it’s a calculated move based on several economic principles and market dynamics: Capital Appreciation Potential: Bitcoin’s historical performance, despite its volatility, has shown remarkable long-term growth. If this trend continues, DV8’s Bitcoin holdings could significantly inflate its balance sheet. Attracting New Investment: The move positions DV8 as an innovative, forward-thinking company. This can attract a new class of investors who are keen on crypto exposure but prefer to gain it through publicly traded, regulated entities rather than direct crypto purchases. Inflationary Hedging: As discussed, holding Bitcoin can protect the company’s capital from the eroding effects of inflation, preserving and potentially growing its purchasing power over time. Scarcity Premium: Bitcoin’s finite supply makes it a scarce asset, a characteristic that often commands a premium in financial markets. By transforming its treasury, DV8 is essentially offering its shareholders indirect exposure to Bitcoin’s upside potential, without them having to navigate the complexities of direct crypto ownership, custody, or regulatory nuances. Challenges and Considerations for DV8 While the potential benefits are significant, DV8’s pioneering move is not without its challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is famously volatile. Significant price drops could lead to impairment charges on DV8’s balance sheet, potentially impacting reported earnings and investor sentiment. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in Southeast Asia, while evolving, is still fragmented. Future regulations could impact the company’s ability to hold or manage its crypto assets. Custody and Security: Securing large amounts of Bitcoin requires sophisticated custody solutions and robust cybersecurity measures to prevent hacks or loss. Accounting Implications: Accounting for Bitcoin on corporate balance sheets can be complex, often requiring companies to record impairment losses when the price drops below their cost basis. Market Perception: While many will laud the move, some traditional investors might view it as too risky or speculative, potentially affecting the company’s traditional investor base. DV8 will need to navigate these complexities with careful risk management and transparent communication to its shareholders. Actionable Insights for Other Companies and Investors DV8’s decision offers valuable lessons and considerations for other corporate treasuries and individual investors: For Corporations: Evaluate your risk appetite and long-term financial goals. Consider a phased approach to Bitcoin adoption, starting with a smaller allocation. Research secure custody solutions and understand the accounting implications. For Investors: This move validates the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. It offers a new avenue for exposure to Bitcoin’s price action through traditional stock markets, particularly for those in Southeast Asia. Always conduct your own due diligence on the company’s overall financial health and strategy. The Future of Treasury: This trend suggests that corporate treasuries are no longer static entities focused solely on cash preservation. They are becoming dynamic vehicles for strategic asset allocation, embracing new technologies and asset classes. A Glimpse into the Future DV8’s transformation into Southeast Asia’s first Bitcoin treasury firm is more than just a corporate strategy; it’s a testament to the evolving financial landscape. It signifies a growing recognition among publicly listed companies that digital assets, particularly Bitcoin, can play a legitimate and valuable role in modern corporate finance. As the first mover in a dynamic region, DV8’s journey will be closely watched, potentially paving the way for a new wave of corporate crypto adoption across Asia and beyond. This bold step could very well redefine how companies perceive and manage their most vital assets in the digital age.

        "BODY": "Open interest in perpetual contracts on XRP has reached $10 billion. Exchanges are recording growth in funding rates and increased demand for long positions. Investors are betting on institutional acceptance and more favorable regulation in the US. XRP rose more than 8% overnight, reaching $3.29—its highest level in six months, according to TradingView. At the time of writing, the asset’s market capitalization is $194.8 billion. Over the past week, the XRP price jumped 36.9%. Analysts attribute this growth to a sharp increase in open interest in perpetual futures and trader optimism amid potential regulatory relaxations. According to CoinGlass, total open positions in perpetual XRP futures have reached $10 billion, which equates to over 3 billion XRP. This figure surpasses the previous high of $8.3 billion recorded in January 2025. Bitget and Binance are the volume leaders, with $2.19 billion and $1.62 billion, respectively. The market shows a pronounced bullish sentiment, according to many experts. On most platforms, funding rates are positive and continue to grow. This means that traders betting on price appreciation are willing to pay a premium to hold positions. Amberdata analysts have noted that investor behavior points to FOMO. “When people experience fear of missing out and believe the price will rise, they are willing to pay higher funding rates to take long positions,” said Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata. Experts believe that XRP’s popularity among retail investors also fuels demand. Additionally, the possibility of its integration into regulated services provides an additional boost. According to Messari analyst Matt Kreiser, XRP Ledger’s infrastructure includes built-in compliance features, making the asset promising amid ongoing discussions about stablecoin legislation. The recent price surge is also likely influenced by the resolution of a multi-year legal dispute between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As the case nears its conclusion, analysts believe the improved regulatory climate could be a potential driver for further XRP gains.",

        "BODY": "Violent attacks targeting cryptocurrency holders are on track to hit record highs in 2025, with Asia-Pacific among the hardest-hit regions, according to a new report from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. These incidents, commonly known as “wrench attacks,” involve criminals using physical violence or threats to coerce victims into surrendering their digital assets. 2025 On Track to Double Record Year for Crypto-Linked Kidnappings and Thefts As of July, 35 wrench attacks have already been recorded globally, surpassing nearly all previous years and placing 2025 on course to double the record set during the 2021 bull run. Source: Jameson Lopp GitHub Chainalysis says the spike is closely tied to Bitcoin’s rising price, which hit an all-time high of over $122,000 in early July . “These are not just digital crimes anymore,” a Chainalysis spokesperson said. “We’re seeing more kidnappings, extortion cases, and home invasions tied to crypto ownership—particularly in regions with fast-growing retail adoption.” The shift from online exploits to real-world violence comes amid a broader wave of crypto-related theft. Chainalysis estimates that over $2.17 billion has been stolen from cryptocurrency services so far in 2025, already surpassing the total for all of 2024 . Now, attacks on personal wallets account for nearly a quarter of all stolen funds this year. Chainalysis reports that these crimes are increasingly targeting users, often with devastating consequences. Bitcoin holders, in particular, are experiencing higher average losses, as criminals appear to prioritize large-value wallets. Chainalysis data also shows that the Asia-Pacific region ranks second globally in total Bitcoin stolen and third in Ether theft. Within APAC, countries like Japan, Indonesia, and South Korea have reported a rise in thefts, while nations such as the Philippines are grappling with more extreme outcomes. Source: Chainalysis Chainalysis warns that while wrench attacks are still relatively rare, they have an outsized impact. The physical nature of these crimes, including cases of maiming, kidnapping, and homicide, raises new concerns for crypto users and law enforcement alike. Crypto Wallet Thefts Shift Toward Retail Targets as Losses Mount in 2025 New data reveals a growing trend in crypto-related crimes targeting retail wallet holders, with wallet thefts now causing major financial damage across both developed and emerging markets. While the United States, Germany, and Japan report the highest number of victims, countries like India, Chile, the United Arab Emirates, and Norway are seeing higher average losses per victim. According to Chainalysis, North America currently leads the world in total crypto stolen, followed by Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. The shift toward targeting users, rather than exchanges or protocols, reflects broader changes in the crypto threat environment. One reason for this shift is improved cybersecurity at centralized exchanges, which has made large platforms more difficult for attackers to penetrate. At the same time, the rising number of high-value self-custodied wallets and the relative ease of identifying crypto holders online have made users increasingly attractive targets. Chainalysis also noted a rise in attacker sophistication, pointing to the use of AI-driven tools to locate, deceive, or coerce victims. “The rise of wrench attacks is a stark reminder that digital assets are only as safe as the people who hold them,” the firm said. Recent findings from blockchain security firm CertiK support the trend. In its midyear report for 2025, CertiK said crypto investors lost more than $2.2 billion to hacks, scams, and security breaches in just the first six months of the year. Crypto investors have lost $2.2B to hacks and scams in H1 2025, with $187M recovered as threats shift, reports @CertiK . #CryptoSecurity #Cryptohacks https://t.co/5KCaVsYnbg — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 30, 2025 Wallet breaches alone accounted for $1.7 billion across only 34 incidents, making it the most costly threat category so far. Phishing attacks followed, with more than $410 million stolen across 132 cases. While the total number of security incidents was 344, two major attacks, on Bybit and Cetus Protocol, accounted for $1.78 billion of the total losses. Excluding those, the remaining $690 million in damages brings 2025’s figures closer to previous years.

        "BODY": "A US judge has cleared the way for a group of writers to sue AI company Anthropic over claims their books were used without permission to train an artificial intelligence model. The decision means the authors can proceed as a group in a class action lawsuit. It is the latest sign that tensions are boiling over between artists and AI firms that rely on vast amounts of online content , often created by real humans, to make their bots smarter. The authors, all published professionals, say Anthropic trained its Claude chatbot on their copyrighted books without asking or paying. They argue the company crossed the line by using their stories to teach AI how to sound more human, even mimicking their styles and ideas. Judge says authors can band together against Anthropic Judge Vince Chhabria, sitting in San Francisco, ruled that the authors shared enough in common to make the case a class action. That’s big. It means this won’t be dozens of separate, drawn-out lawsuits; instead, one case, with collective weight. The core questions? Did Anthropic actually copy their work? And if it did, was that use “fair,” or did it break copyright law? Anthropic had hoped to knock the case down before it got off the ground by insisting each writer should sue separately, but the judge did not buy it. He said the underlying issues were basically the same, and better dealt with all at once. This puts more legal heat on AI developers, many of whom are already under scrutiny for how they gather the data that trains their tools. The lawsuit is far from an isolated incident. Around the world, creative professionals are pushing back against what they see as unauthorized and unfair use of their work by AI companies. Getty Images is currently in a fierce battle with Stability AI over claims that millions of its photos were used without a license. In the music world, big record labels are suing companies making AI-generated songs. Music publishers have accused AI firms, including Anthropic, of using copyrighted music lyrics in training Claude . And over in Hollywood, studios like Disney are accusing Midjourney of borrowing too freely from their film characters. The trend is clear: creators are drawing lines in the sand. And the tech world is being forced to listen. AI firms, Anthropic included, say they are just “learning” Anthropic and others in the industry argue that they are not stealing, but they are training. They say the process is a lot like how a person reads a ton of books and then writes something in their own words. According to this logic, the AI is not copying, but is learning. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has made that case publicly. Without copyrighted material, he has said, the world would not have tools like ChatGPT at all. But many artists are not buying it, especially when the AI-generated output feels eerily close to the original source. It is one thing to be inspired, while it is another to blur the line between borrowing and ripping off. With the class action now moving forward, more authors could join the case. If the group wins, it could lead to financial compensation and maybe even force AI companies to rethink how they gather training data. This legal battle is not just about books or bots. It is about who gets to profit from human creativity, and whether machines should be allowed to learn from art without consent. As the AI boom races ahead, courts will likely play a huge role in deciding where the boundaries lie. The case could determine how AI firms approach copyrighted work when training their AI models going forward. And for now, writers are fighting to make sure they are not erased in the process.

        "BODY": "Russia's largest bank, Sberbank, has announced plans to offer custody services for Russian crypto assets in a bid to increase its influence in the country's cryptocurrency space. With this step, the state-owned bank aims to take a leading role in Russia's development of digital assets. Anatoly Pronin, Executive Director of the bank's Alternative Payment Solutions Department, noted that cryptocurrency custody services are becoming increasingly widespread globally, and that Sberbank has submitted regulatory proposals to the Central Bank of Russia accordingly. Pronin argued that cryptocurrencies should be regulated similarly to traditional assets held in bank accounts and that the bank will ensure the security of customers' tokens. Related News: BREAKING: BlackRock Makes a Surprise Ethereum Move - Expected Feature May Come Soon Russia's Central Bank softened its stance on cryptocurrencies last year, after long opposing them, and supported legislation allowing companies to use these assets in international trade. This change is seen as part of strategies aimed at mitigating the impact of Western sanctions. Custody services allow assets to be frozen if malicious activity is suspected, while also facilitating easier transactions and protecting accounts from cyberattacks. “Custody services are the backbone of the cryptocurrency economy. Currently, these services are mostly in the hands of foreign private companies, which poses a significant risk,” said Gleb Zemskoy, director of blockchain technology and digital currency development at Insight Finance. *This is not investment advice.

        "BODY": "Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) doubled down on her anti-crypto legislative statements by saying the CLARITY Act would cause “investor harm” as part of her “Anti-Crypto Corruption Week” initiative in a new press release on Thursday. Rep. Maxine Waters Slams Crypto Bills In Fiery Press Release Published on the Democrats’ U.S. House Committee on Financial Services website , Waters slammed the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, better known as the CLARITY Act. “The bill presents several serious risks: it exposes consumers to exploitation by bad actors in the crypto industry, undermines national security, and ignores Donald Trump’s escalating conflicts of interest tied to his personal involvement in cryptocurrency,” Waters wrote. Three crypto bills are now officially being debated on the House floor before a vote Congresswoman Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the Financial Services Committee, doesn’t look too pleased… pic.twitter.com/18r6IFMR18 — ThuanCapitalGlobal (@ThuanGlobal) July 17, 2025 “This bill, which should be called the ‘ CALAMITY Act ,’ is bad public policy, plain and simple,” she added. “This bill would lead to increased investor harm, plant the seeds for the next financial crisis, and endanger our national security.” Donald Trump’s Crypto Ties Questioned Waters’ latest press release comes the same day U.S. lawmakers are slated to hold a floor vote on key crypto legislation amid Republicans’ self-declared “Crypto Week.” The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation For U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act is also being considered alongside the CLARITY Act and anti-Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) provisions. While the pieces of digital asset legislation are widely seen as positive by the crypto community, critics of the bills argue that they lack necessary regulatory oversight and potentially allow politicians to profit from their own cryptocurrencies. U.S. President Donald Trump has faced growing scrutiny in recent months over his ties to the digital asset sector after having launched his $TRUMP namesake memecoin this past January. Shortly after, the Trump-affiliated crypto platform World Liberty Financial launched its own stablecoin, USD1. “No one should be surprised that the Republicans’ next order of business is a billion-dollar handout to the President himself,” Waters said.

        "BODY": "World-leading asset manager BlackRock has applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow staking for its spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF). Nasdaq filed the proposed rule change on July 17. If approved, the firm can stake part or all of the ETH underlying its spot ETH ETF (ETHA) through any staking services providers. With the move, BlackRock has joined the list of spot ETH ETF issuers seeking SEC approval to allow staking. While others, such as Franklin Templeton, Fidelity , 21Shares, and Grayscale, have already applied for the same permit, the move by BlackRock represents the biggest positive sign of potential approval of such products. Efforts to allow staking for ETH ETFs and other altcoin ETFs have intensified since the Donald Trump administration started, and the SEC has changed its approach to many crypto issues, including Ethereum staking. This led to the regulator dropping staking-related lawsuits against Coinbase and Kraken. Before now, the ETF issuers were forced to amend their filings and drop staking from their Ethereum ETF applications in 2024 after the Gary Gensler-led SEC flagged Ethereum staking, noting that it could be unregistered securities. Fight for ETH staking in ETFs that are far from over With BlackRock submitting its 19b-4 filing, many in the crypto industry believe that staking for ETFs is now a done deal. This is not surprising given the firm’s record of only one refusal by the SEC for all its ETF applications and over 500 approvals. However, experts believe that the fight is not over yet. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart noted that there are several staking ETF filings before the SEC, and for earlier filings, the final deadline is late October. The final deadline for BlackRock’s filing is not until April 2026, but the analyst expects a decision from the regulator by Q4 of this year. Seyffart said: “Staking is not ‘done.’ There are plenty of ETH staking ETF filings already on the books. Final deadline for earlier filings is in late October. The Blackrock filing today won’t have a final deadline until ~April 2026 (but we think staking will likely be approved by at least 4Q25).” Seyffart noted that the major challenge that staking ETF approval will face now is not from the SEC but rather from the Internal Revenue Service. However, he did not go further into how this could be a problem. ETH doubles in value within 3 months thanks to ETFs and Institutional accumulation Meanwhile, the timing of BlackRock’s filing coincides with ETH’s recent performance, which has seen the token wipe out all its losses for the year and finally have a positive year-to-date performance. Over the past three months, ETH price has increased by 114%, a trend that is also evident within shorter periods, with a 38.5% gain in 30 days and 21.12% gains in seven days. The token is now trading at $3,420 and is up 2% year to date. BlackRock filing likely contributed to its gains with the almost 4% rise in ETH value today in what looks like the start of the altcoin season, with ETH, XRP, SOL, and BNB seeing gains while Bitcoin recorded a slight drop. Massive inflows into ETH ETFs in the past few months (Source: James Seyffart) However, the biggest contributor to ETH’s resurgence is likely the institutional interest evident in its ETFs’ inflows and ETH treasury companies’ accumulation. Data shared by Seyffart noted that ETH ETFs now have over $5.5 billion in inflows since launch, with $3.3 billion coming since mid-April. While this is relatively small compared to the $18 billion in net flow for Bitcoin ETFs in the last three months, it highlights the rising interest in spot ETH ETFs. That interest is likely to increase if staking is allowed for the product. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

        "BODY": "Almost 60% of participants in the PUMP token presale have sold or transferred their assets to centralized exchanges and other wallets, according to BitMEX analysts. Of 10,145 ICO participants, 6,042 wallets (59.6%) have sold or moved their tokens. 3,791 (37.4%) continue to hold their assets, and 312 addresses (3%) have increased their positions since launch. The PUMP presale ended in 12 minutes, raising $500 million USD. Soon after, the token reached an all-time high of $0.006812. As of the time of writing, the coin is trading at $0.005221 (down 19.2%), according to CoinGecko. BitMEX analysts have noted that PUMP exceeded expectations. Usually, a large percentage of tokens unlocked at launch can lead to aggressive selling and price pressure. However, funding rates on PUMP perpetual futures remain positive. This indicates the market’s confidence in the asset’s potential for growth. The main concern is the decline in trading volumes on the Pump.fun platform itself. In January, trading volume was $11.6 billion; by June, it had fallen to $3.65 billion. If this trend continues, it will be difficult to maintain the token’s current valuation, BitMEX emphasized. Meme Coin Market Update Since the beginning of July, the market capitalization of the meme coin sector has increased by $17 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. The figure reached $72 billion, up 29% since June 30. At its peak, daily trading volume has exceeded $18 billion. Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe have shown growth over the past seven days. However, the leaders of the week were Floki (+43%), Pudgy Penguins (+63%), and Bonk (+70%). Bonk’s growth is attributed to a new Solana-based launchpad called LetsBonk, where Pump.fun took the lead in daily revenue right before its initial coin offering. According to DeFi Llama, the new platform has generated $8.25 million in revenue over the past seven days, compared to $4.91 million for its competitor. According to aggregator Jupiter, LetsBonk’s market share reached 54.7% over 24 hours, while Pump.fun had 38%. The new launchpad’s trading volume totaled $925 million, surpassing Pump.fun’s $643 million. At the same time, Pump.fun leads in 24-hour trader count: 415,000 versus 283,000 for LetsBonk. Liquidity on Pump.fun reaches $512 million, which is almost ten times higher than its competitor’s liquidity of $53 million.",

        "BODY": "Following internal Republican wrangling, the US House of Representatives has passed a bill containing comprehensive regulations for the cryptocurrency market. The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act was approved by a vote of 294-134, with 78 Democrats and all Republicans supporting the bill. Lawmakers voted 308-122 for the stablecoin bill, GENIUS. GENIUS, which has already passed the Senate, requires the stablecoin to be fully backed by US dollars or similarly liquid assets, mandates annual audits for issuers with a market capitalization greater than $50 billion, and establishes guidelines for foreign issuances. In addition, the Anti-CBDC bill was also approved by vote. This development in the House of Representatives came at the end of a grueling process dubbed “crypto week.” GOP leadership had hoped to easily pass three bills related to digital assets. However, on Tuesday, some hard-line Republicans blocked a procedural vote, stalling the bill. President Donald Trump then intervened and attempted to broker a deal with the lawmakers. Related News: How Much Is Vitalik Buterin's Fortune After The Last Big Rally In Ethereum? Here is His Wallet and Altcoins Trump's compromise included adding language from the “Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act” to the crypto regulation bill, which would ban the Fed from issuing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). However, this move failed to stop the rebellion and angered another faction within the party. After hours of negotiations and the longest vote in House history, leadership agreed to add the anti-CBDC provisions to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). This strategic change increased the bill's chances of reaching Trump's desk. Most Republican opponents then switched their votes to “yes,” and the voting process was reinstated. *This is not investment advice.

        "BODY": "The crypto market is treading cautiously, slowed down by regulatory delays and mixed sentiment. The Avalanche ETF decision remains on hold, keeping AVAX traders on edge. Meanwhile, Chainlink (LINK) has managed a clean breakout, holding its revised target at $22. But while some wait and others climb slowly, BlockDAG (BDAG) is already moving full speed ahead. Miner shipments have begun, and mining is now live on the X1 app, which already boasts over 2 million users. The presale has generated over $340 million so far. Buyers can still lock in the $0.0016 price until August 11. When comparing momentum, preparation, and delivery, BlockDAG easily stands out as the best crypto for 2025. Avalanche ETF Delay Adds Uncertainty to AVAX Outlook Grayscale’s pending Avalanche ETF continues to face delays from the SEC, making AVAX’s short-term outlook unclear. Although the ETF could provide traditional investors with safer access to Avalanche, regulators remain cautious. The ongoing pause highlights the broader hesitations around altcoin ETFs. Historical delays, particularly for non-Bitcoin assets, suggest a long road ahead. If approved, the Avalanche ETF could improve AVAX’s liquidity and public exposure, but the current regulatory stance puts any launch on hold. Until further decisions are made, AVAX may remain range-bound. Chainlink Price Target Raised After Breaking Out The Chainlink (LINK) price target now stands at $22, following a clean technical breakout above its previous trendline. With solid support above $15 and consistent higher lows from $10.50, LINK’s structure appears bullish. The key level to watch is $17.40, which analysts see as the next stepping stone. Momentum indicators, including the Awesome Oscillator and CMF, are showing strong inflows and buyer activity. As long as Chainlink maintains these levels, its $22 target remains well within reach. BlockDAG Scales Ahead with Hardware, Users, & Presale Strength BlockDAG isn’t waiting for approvals or sentiment shifts. It’s executing. Mining hardware has been shipped. The X1 app now supports over 2 million active users. Hardware sales have crossed $7.5 million, and 18,563 X-series mining devices have already been sold. Its presale is also making headlines, raising $340 million and distributing 24 billion BDAG coins. With the price at $0.0016 until August 11, and the official GLOBAL LAUNCH release price set at $0.05, the potential ROI for current buyers hits 3025%. BlockDAG isn’t just another crypto project, it’s a self-contained ecosystem built from the ground up. It isn’t reliant on rented networks or outside platforms. With everything from mobile mining to exchange listings handled internally, it’s showing how crypto can operate independently and efficiently. Early buyers are already benefiting through mining rewards, app participation, and hardware engagement. As BlockDAG enters the final stages of presale, this could be the last window for getting in before the market adjusts to launch pricing. Why BlockDAG Is the Best Crypto for 2025 While the Avalanche ETF delay shows the risks of regulatory dependence, and Chainlink’s price target hinges on technical levels, BlockDAG is proving that momentum comes from action. It already has 200,000 holders and a rapidly growing base of 2 million miners. With more than $340 million raised, a fixed entry point of $0.0016 until August 11, and full infrastructure rollout underway, BlockDAG is offering more than speculation. It’s delivering results and building trust. Unlike AVAX and LINK, which still need external events to move, BlockDAG is already creating value. As its GLOBAL LAUNCH release nears, this project continues to earn its reputation as the best crypto for 2025 .

        "SOURCE_ID": 67,
        "BODY": "A rumor suggesting Ripple might pay its court-imposed penalty using XRP has been firmly shut down by former SEC attorney Marc Fagel. The claim, which resurfaced this week within the XRP community, was sparked by speculation that the U.S. government’s recent Bitcoin sales were linked to preparations for accepting XRP as a settlement currency. Fagel, however, directly dismissed this theory as fiction, stating that Ripple has already paid the penalty in cash as ordered by the court. XRP Community Speculation Resurfaces The discussion was reignited when crypto personality Zach Rector posed a provocative question on X: “Why didn’t the government want to hold onto its Bitcoin?” In response, XRP commentator “XRP Savant” suggested it was part of a broader setup for Ripple to settle its SEC penalty in XRP. “Setting the stage for Ripple to pay $150M SEC fine with XRP. Then it goes into reserve,” Savant claimed, adding, “As I predicted 4 months ago. It’s nice to see the experts finally catch up with the Savant.” They already paid in cash. Sorry. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) July 16, 2025 Savant also cited an April 11 post by analyst John Squire, who wrote: “Ripple vs SEC: The endgame is near. Brad Garlinghouse confirms the lawsuit might be wrapping up. The fine could even be paid in XRP.” Marc Fagel Sets the Record Straight Marc Fagel, a former SEC San Francisco Regional Director, quickly entered the conversation to correct the record. Quoting the original claim, he stated unequivocally: “They already paid in cash. Sorry.” When pressed with Squire’s speculative post, Fagel followed up with a firmer clarification: “I’m stating facts. There’s a court order that they pay cash into escrow. But you can imagine anything you’d like.” Fagel’s comments refer to court documents from the Ripple case, which show that the company was ordered to deposit $125 million, not $150 million, into escrow in U.S. dollars as part of its proposed final judgment with the SEC. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Legal Reality vs. Community Hopes While XRP Savant and others continue to push the narrative of XRP being used for institutional settlements or even government reserves, there is no legal basis or regulatory precedent supporting such claims. Courts require penalties to be paid in fiat currency, especially when dealing with assets that are still subject to regulatory scrutiny. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has indeed expressed optimism about the lawsuit nearing its conclusion. But there is no public indication, either from Ripple or the SEC, that XRP was ever considered a valid form of payment for the penalty. Cash, Not Crypto Marc Fagel’s comments cut through the noise of crypto speculation with a dose of legal clarity. Ripple’s $125 million fine has been paid in U.S. dollars, not in XRP. While XRP remains central to Ripple’s technology and broader financial ambitions, it is not, as Fagel put it, a substitute for compliance: “There’s a court order that they pay cash. But you can imagine anything you’d like.” In a space often dominated by speculation, facts still matter, and in this case, the facts are crystal clear.

        "BODY": "On-chain data shows the supply held by new Bitcoin buyers has seen a jump recently, a sign that the latest price rally is backed by fresh capital. First-Time Bitcoin Buyers Have Increased Supply By 2.86% In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the Bitcoin ‘First Buyers.’ This cohort is part of Glassnode’s broader investor classification system that is based on behavior. The First Buyers include, as the name already hints, the holders who are buying the cryptocurrency for the first time. The supply associated with the group, therefore, can be considered as a proxy of the fresh capital entering into the sector. Related Reading: XRP Close Above This Level Could Send Price To $4.80, Analyst Says Other groups part of the behavioral classification include Momentum Buyers, the investors who ride the tide of price trends, and Conviction Buyers, who step in to buy during price declines. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Bitcoin supply held by the First Buyers over the last couple of weeks. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin First Buyers have seen their supply go up during the last two weeks, implying that fresh capital has potentially been entering the market. More specifically, the cohort’s holdings have gone from 4.77 million BTC to 4.91 million BTC in this period, corresponding to an increase of around 140,000 tokens or 2.86%. This is notable and suggests the price surge to the new all-time high (ATH) has attracted real demand. In some other news, the Bitcoin Puell Multiple has been relatively muted even after the price rally, as an analyst has pointed out in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post. The Puell Multiple is an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the daily value of coins being ‘issued’ by miners on the blockchain (in USD) and the 365-day moving average (MA) of the same. In short, the indicator informs us about whether the Bitcoin miners are currently making more revenue from block subsidy compared to the norm or not. Historically, the indicator shooting up to an extreme value has generally aligned with some sort of top for the cryptocurrency. As is visible in the chart, the BTC Puell Multiple is currently sitting around 1.2, which means that miners are making more than the average for the past year, but not by too much. If the past trend is anything to go by, this may be a potential sign that the current cycle still has room for growth. Related Reading: Bitcoin Next Key Level Is $136,000 If Momentum Holds, Glassnode Says Something to note, however, is the fact that the indicator’s peaks have been trending lower with each cycle. Thus, it’s possible that the metric would also top out at a lower level of miner revenue this time around. BTC Price Bitcoin hasn’t been able to sustain recovery since its low as its price is still trading around $117,000.

        "BODY": "Ethereum’s (ETH) recent rally has reignited market optimism, pushing trading volumes higher and rekindling risk-on sentiment across the digital asset market. But while ETH grabs headlines, a growing number of analysts are zeroing in on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a sub-$1 DeFi gem that’s quietly building momentum. Mutuum Finance is priced at $0.03 in the 5th presale phase, well over 75% sold out. Investors in this stage will enjoy a 100% return on investment when the token is listed. Well over $12.5 million has been raised and more than 13,500 early-stage investors. The token will rise in presale Phase 6 to $0.035, and that is 16.67% return on investments done in Phase 5. Mutuum Finance is being positioned not just as a trending altcoin, but as one of the most compelling early-stage narratives in today’s market. Ethereum Holds Momentum Amid Institutional Backing Ethereum has sustained its momentum above the $3,100 mark, currently trading around $3,163, following a sharp 5% intraday move that triggered widespread short-covering. Market technicians highlight a clear “cup-and-handle” breakout from the $2,850 neckline, an indicator that often precedes a continuation toward the $4,200 zone. Institutional demand remains robust: spot ETF inflows have recently exceeded $500 million, while corporate treasuries and whale wallets continue to accumulate at levels near $3,000–$3,100. On-chain metrics reinforce this positive bias, with declining exchange reserves and rising open interest signaling sustained holding and renewed confidence. Overall, Ethereum is exhibiting a structurally strong profile in both technical and fundamental dimensions, while Mutuum Finance also merits monitoring. Investor Demand Propels Mutuum Presale to $12.5M Mutuum Finance presale has more than 13500 investors and is more than $12.5 million in funds. Investors have put over 75% of the tokens in phase 5. This indicates growing confidence by the investors in the project’s near-term success as well as its better future. Mutuum Finance Launches Major Token Giveaway Program Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering $100,000 giveaway , distributed among 10 winners of $10,000 in MUTM tokens. Otherwise, the top 50 holders of the Mutuum Finance will be rewarded based on its new leaderboard system. The bonus tokens will be given to the users when they level up. Mutuum Finance’s Model for Transforming DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is innovating DeFi lending with the creation of a platform that renders customers the sole proprietor of their own assets. It is a functional double-lending multifunctional platform, combining the synergy of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. In P2C, smart contracts are used to access lending pools. The platform responds to real-time market conditions, a factor that makes lenders’ returns less volatile and the borrower financially stable. With the elimination of intermediaries, the P2P model provides direct lending, which is very convenient on highly volatile assets like other coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly becoming one of the most talked-about DeFi projects of 2025. Now in Stage 5 of its presale and priced at just $0.03, the project has already raised over $12.5 million from more than 13,500 investors, with over 75% of tokens in this phase already sold. As Ethereum continues to rally, attention is shifting to new opportunities with stronger upside potential, and Mutuum is leading that conversation. Backed by a game-changing DeFi model, a $100K token giveaway, and imminent price increases, now is the time to explore Mutuum Finance before the next phase kicks in.

        "BODY": "Key Takeaways: Former Deputy Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao proposed integrating RMB-backed stablecoins into China’s national financial framework. He described dollar-backed stablecoins as a continuation of U.S. monetary dominance via digital channels. The proposal implies a gradual path to currency internationalization without loosening China’s capital controls. At a closed-door seminar hosted by the New Economists Think Tank, former Deputy Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao proposed incorporating yuan-backed stablecoins into China’s top-level financial strategy, citing shifts in U.S. policy and emerging global stablecoin infrastructure. According to New Economists , Zhu focused exclusively on fiat-backed stablecoins, excluding other digital assets, and examined their growing role in international finance. Zhu Warns of U.S. Stablecoins He described dollar-pegged stablecoins as an extension of U.S. monetary strategy, stating they may represent “the third phase of the Bretton Woods system.” The original Bretton Woods structure, introduced in 1944, tied global currencies to the U.S. dollar, itself pegged to gold. After the gold-dollar link was severed in 1971, the U.S. maintained dominance through dollar-priced oil trade. Without regulatory support for yuan-backed stablecoins, China risks falling behind in digital finance infrastructure. #china #stablecoin https://t.co/5XxK6NlwSv — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 1, 2025 Today, Zhu argued, dollar-backed stablecoins serve as a new mechanism to sustain that position. Based on the data presented, stablecoin transaction volumes reached $27.6 trillion in 2024, exceeding those of Visa and Mastercard, while cross-border payments surpassed $250 trillion. The U.S. dollar remained the top settlement currency, accounting for nearly half of all SWIFT transactions in May. Zhu said recent U.S. regulatory actions, including the June passage of the Lummis–Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act, indicate an effort to consolidate dollar-based stablecoins within a U.S.-regulated framework. The law requires all such stablecoins to be fully backed by liquid U.S. assets and issued by licensed entities, reinforcing dollar liquidity and extending extraterritorial influence. He also cited the U.S. Treasury’s gold revaluation discussions and the Fed’s easing of capital reserve rules for banks as signs of coordinated fiscal recalibration, potentially to accommodate stablecoin growth. China’s Internationalization of CNY Zhu proposed three policy directions for China: treat Hong Kong as a regulatory sandbox under the new stablecoin ordinance; develop offshore and domestic CNY stablecoins; and monitor how U.S. regulators enforce fiat-backed stablecoin rules, including constraints on foreign issuers. He concluded by stating that “this must become part of our national financial strategy,” referencing stablecoin development under Chinese monetary frameworks. Integrating yuan-backed stablecoins into global payments could diversify settlement channels beyond SWIFT and CHIPS, especially in regions where China has built trade or infrastructure ties. If designed to interoperate with foreign platforms while complying with international audit and reserve standards, Chinese stablecoins could serve as a tool for incremental currency internationalization without the capital account liberalization associated with full convertibility. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How might foreign governments react to a Chinese-issued stablecoin in global markets? Regulatory responses may vary. Countries aligned with U.S. policy could resist infrastructure relying on CNY settlement, while others may view it as a means to reduce dollar exposure or diversify reserves. Some may raise concerns about financial surveillance or political dependencies. Could CNY stablecoins be integrated into Belt and Road projects? A yuan-backed stablecoin could theoretically support project financing, payment clearing, and supply chain settlements across Belt and Road corridors. This would require coordinated regulatory agreements and technical interoperability with partner nations’ financial systems. What role might central banks play in shaping private stablecoin infrastructure? Some central banks may issue standards or licenses to oversee fiat-backed stablecoin operators, while others may collaborate through multilateral mechanisms to enforce reserve rules, interoperability, or cross-border settlement conditions.

        "BODY": "The Singapore High Court has set aside its June 4, 2025, order rejecting WazirX’s restructuring plan and ordered a new creditor vote on an amended scheme, potentially clearing the path for the exchange to reopen and begin distributing funds to users affected by the $230 million hack in July 2024. The court extended Zettai’s moratorium protection and allowed the revote following further arguments presented by WazirX’s parent company. If the amended scheme receives approval from the requisite majority of creditors and court sanction, the WazirX platform will reopen with Zanmai facilitating distributions under Indian jurisdiction. Update on Court Hearing The Singapore High Court has set aside its 4th June 2025 order in SUM 940, and has allowed a revote to be conducted based on an amended scheme. Zettai’s moratorium has also been extended. This decision follows further arguments presented by Zettai.… pic.twitter.com/j0pfywAufo — WazirX: India Ka Bitcoin Exchange (@WazirXIndia) July 16, 2025 Singapore High Court Has Ruled, Giving Users Hope The decision marks a dramatic reversal after the court previously rejected the moratorium application, citing concerns about transparency regarding Zettai’s undisclosed relocation to Panama and rebranding as Zensui Corporation. The earlier rejection exposed WazirX to potential litigation in India and left users without access to funds for nearly one year. WazirX founder, Nischal Shetty, announced that Proof of Reserves will launch after the platform restarts, stating that current token balances remain unchanged since no deposits or withdrawals are being processed. We will launch Proof of Reserves (POR) after WazirX restarts. Right now, the token balances remain unchanged since no new deposits or withdrawals are being processed while the platform is offline. A live POR at this stage wouldn’t add much value, and would divert resources… https://t.co/1xLSaaFsTu — Nischal (Shardeum) (@NischalShetty) July 17, 2025 An independent assessor has already verified current holdings and submitted the report to the court and creditors. Additionally, the exchange initially pledged to return 85% of user balances through recovery tokens representing unrecovered funds, though legal challenges and investor objections have stalled progress. Users have expressed frustration over repeated delays and a lack of transparency throughout the recovery process. Court Reversal Provides Second Chance for Fund Recovery The Singapore High Court’s decision to allow a revote followed months of legal uncertainty after the initial restructuring plan faced rejection. The court had previously declined to sanction WazirX’s proposal due to transparency issues surrounding Zettai’s corporate restructuring and relocation activities. WazirX had secured a four-month conditional moratorium in September 2024, which protected the company from litigation in different regions. The June 4 rejection also opened the door for Indian users to file litigation domestically to seek recovery of their locked funds. The exchange warned users in February that repayments could be delayed until 2030 if the court rejected the restructuring plan, potentially forcing the company into liquidation. A successful restructuring would allow faster, structured repayments with possible profit-sharing benefits. Singapore High Court extends @WazirXIndia ’s moratorium, allowing the exchange a final opportunity to present restructuring arguments after the $234M crypto hack. #Singapore #WazirX https://t.co/SsLj5zr218 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 24, 2025 More than 93% of voting creditors approved the initial restructuring plan in April 2025 ; however, legal complications and resistance from Zettai delayed its implementation. The amended scheme addresses court concerns while maintaining the core framework for user compensation. The Monetary Authority of Singapore issued a notice on May 30 requiring all unlicensed exchanges operating in Singapore to cease services by June 30. Zettai’s relocation to Panama and rebranding as Zensui Corporation were intended to address regulatory compliance issues. How WazirX Got Here: The Big Disaster The WazirX hack in July 2024 resulted from hackers exploiting vulnerabilities in the exchange’s multisig wallet system, manipulating the interface to trick authorized signers into approving a malicious smart contract upgrade. The attack bypassed established security measures and drained approximately $230 million in cryptocurrency assets. The hack also exposed ownership conflicts between Zettai and Binance regarding WazirX operations, complicating the restructuring process. Users have demanded greater transparency and implementation of Proof of Reserves to prevent future security incidents. TBH….Indian crypto users just wants their funds BACK They’re tired of your lies. They know how clearly you’ve exploited them, how many times you’ve hidden the truth You still haven’t even made the real #WazirX PoR public & it's been 1 year now !!! pic.twitter.com/w3J10H0sOA — Ajay Kashyap (@EverythingAjay) July 17, 2025 WazirX plans to issue recovery tokens as on-chain IOUs representing unrecovered funds, designed to help users claim between 75% and 80% of their affected balances, depending on market conditions. However, the tokens remain speculative pending successful completion of the restructuring process. The exchange has committed to completing the revoting process as quickly as possible, with distributions beginning promptly if the amended scheme receives approval. Users await concrete timelines for the voting process and the potential reopening of the platform, which has been suspended for nearly a year.

        "BODY": "A widely followed crypto analyst says that one Solana ( SOL )-based altcoin that has already seen massive gains looks poised to skyrocket further while updating his outlook on two other popular memecoins. In a new strategy session, pseudonymous crypto trader Bluntz tells his 325,100 followers on the social media platform X that the native asset of the Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ) non-fungible token (NFT) collection appears ready to spark a rally despite already gaining 300% this month. “Nice 18% dip here on PENGU, that should be more than enough in a strong uptrend like this. Should start pushing into fresh highs again from around here [in my opinion].” Source: Bluntz/X The trader’s chart indicates that PENGU could rise to $0.038 during the next few days. The digital asset is trading for $0.0309 at time of writing, a 7.7% decrease on the day. On July 16th, PENGU reached its weekly high of $0.034, a 68% gain from its seven-day low of $0.0184. According to the trader, PENGU feels like a “silent underperformer” as it has been the strongest meme asset during the last two weeks. “Seeing PENGU up 143% in two weeks, has also been the best performing large cap meme (over 1 $billion market cap), I’d think more people would be talking about it. Maybe it’s my own echo bubble but feels like a silent outperformer.” Moving on to the dog-themed meme asset Floki ( FLOKI ), Bluntz says that it has more room to grow before breaking its resistance level around $0.000123. “Nice moves on Floki so far but still plenty of juice left in the tank. Breaking that $0.000123 resistance is inevitable [in my opinion].” Source: Bluntz/X It appears that Bluntz’s prediction came true as FLOKI is trading for $0.000142 at time of writing, a 29% increase on the day. Concluding his analysis with Bonk ( BONK ), another SOL-based memecoin, Bluntz says it appears as if it has much more room to grow despite rising 96% since the beginning of July. “Well that was quick. BONK already +96%, and still looking like it has much higher to go.” BONK is trading for $0.000036 at time of writing, a 4.9% increase on the day.

        "SOURCE_ID": 43,
        "BODY": "U.S. solar manufacturers have filed new trade petitions against India, Indonesia, and Laos, in the latest escalation of trade tensions aimed at curbing China’s growing influence over the global solar supply chain. The petitions allege that Chinese-owned companies operating in those countries are engaging in illegal dumping and receiving unfair government subsidies, undermining domestic solar production in the United States . The filings were submitted by the Alliance for American Solar Manufacturing and Trade, a coalition that includes major players like First Solar Inc., Mission Solar Energy, and Qcells. The group is urging the U.S. government to impose anti-dumping and countervailing duties to level the playing field for U.S.-based manufacturers. Solar exports are fresh targets in an old battle The move comes a few months after the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) voted in favor of imposing tariffs on imports from four Southeast Asian countries, Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand, accusing Chinese producers of using those regions to bypass earlier trade restrictions. With this latest filing, American manufacturers are extending their focus to newer manufacturing hubs tied to Chinese capital and production. At the heart of the petition is the claim that solar panel exports from India, Indonesia, and Laos are unfairly benefiting from subsidies and are being sold in the U.S. at artificially low prices, a practice known as dumping. According to the Alliance, these exports undercut the pricing of domestic manufacturers and threaten the future of America’s solar industrial base. Chinese companies, facing years of aggressive U.S. tariffs, have in recent years shifted manufacturing capacity to friendlier jurisdictions, including India and several ASEAN countries, to retain access to Western markets. That strategy now appears to be facing mounting scrutiny. Ripple effects for global supply chains The trade petitions are the latest chapter in a U.S.–China decoupling effort, particularly in green tech and clean energy sectors. The solar industry has become a focal point for strategic competition, with the U.S. seeking to boost critical manufacturing and reduce reliance on Chinese supply chains. India, for its part, has emerged as a major beneficiary of the global solar pivot. In addition to attracting Chinese firms, Indian solar manufacturers have ramped up exports to the U.S., capitalizing on the void created by trade penalties against other Asian suppliers. But this latest petition could complicate those gains, drawing India deeper into a web of U.S. trade enforcement actions. A recent report highlighted how Indian firms are expanding rapidly to fill U.S. demand, with support from domestic policies like India’s production-linked incentives. But with their supply chains still linked with Chinese machinery and materials, they remain vulnerable to being caught in geopolitical crossfire. While American manufacturers welcomed the petition, other parts of the solar ecosystem are voicing concern. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), which represents developers and installers, has warned in the past that additional tariffs could drive up costs for solar projects and slow the pace of deployment. The U.S. Commerce Department is expected to review the petition. If it finds merit in the claims, the Commerce Department could initiate an investigation that would lead to steep tariffs on the named countries. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

        "BODY": "U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase has officially rebranded its Coinbase Wallet to Base app as part of what the company calls a new chapter for its ecosystem. The new app combines crypto, social media, payments, mini-apps, and is powered by its Ethereum Layer 2 Base network. Coinbase’s All-In-One Product In a July 16 blog post, the company revealed the launch of an “everything app” that will enable individuals to create, earn, trade, discover apps, and chat with friends. “Coinbase Wallet is now the Base app, evolving from a wallet into an everything app…Anyone can manage their assets, post, connect with others, and directly earn from their work,” read the post. The initiative was announced at the company’s “A New Day One” conference in Los Angeles. Head of Product John Granata said the firm has built the app to “expand economic freedom, creativity, and innovation,” adding that it could serve as a starting point for a new kind of social network. During his speech, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said the launch aligns with the exchange’s long-term mission to expand economic freedom through crypto. He explained that the product is part of a shift from traditional finance that aims to create a global, permissionless platform accessible to all. The Base app entered beta for waitlisted users on July 16. It features a new social feed built on the Farcaster protocol where creators can turn their posts into tokens using Zora, earn from direct tips and purchases, and qualify for weekly rewards based on engagement. The feed also lets users view friends’ trading activity and swap tokens instantly without switching screens. It is home to mini apps like Remix, Noice, and Decentralized Pictures. It also supports one-tap USDC payments via NFC and offers encrypted XMTP chat where users can trade tokens, earn yield, share content, or transact with AI agents. Base Pay Goes Live On Shopify Users who sign up on the platform will also be assigned a Base Account, a smart wallet designed to work across different apps and networks. Coinbase has also introduced Base Pay, a checkout option that allows fast payments using USDC. Following its recent partnership with Shopify, the feature is now available to merchants on the e-commerce platform. Later this year, U.S. customers will also earn 1% cash back when paying with USDC. However, Base App rewards are not available in the EU or Canada. The company plans a gradual public release after the beta phase and has also invited developers to integrate “Sign in with Base” into their own products.

        "BODY": "BitcoinWorld Arthur Hayes’ Bold Bet: $2 Million Investment Fuels LDO and AAVE Excitement The crypto world is always buzzing with significant moves from its prominent figures, and this time, the spotlight is on Arthur Hayes , the visionary co-founder of BitMEX. In a development that has sent ripples through the decentralized finance (DeFi) community, Hayes has reportedly made a substantial investment, injecting $1 million each into LDO and AAVE tokens. This strategic acquisition, brought to light by on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X, showcases a fascinating display of confidence in specific corners of the digital asset landscape. What does this mean for the future of these tokens and the broader crypto market? Let’s dive in. Arthur Hayes’ Strategic Investment: A Closer Look When a figure as influential as Arthur Hayes makes a significant move, the crypto community pays attention. Hayes, known for his insightful macroeconomic commentary and early contributions to the crypto exchange space, received a direct transfer of $1 million in LDO and another $1 million in AAVE from Flowdesk, a digital asset trading and technology firm. This isn’t just a casual purchase; it signals a deliberate and calculated decision to allocate substantial capital into two of DeFi’s cornerstone protocols. His past predictions and market analyses have often proven prescient, leading many to ponder the potential implications of this recent action. Is this a vote of confidence in the long-term viability of liquid staking and decentralized lending? It certainly appears to be. Understanding LDO AAVE Tokens: Pillars of DeFi To fully grasp the significance of Arthur Hayes’ investment, it’s crucial to understand what LDO AAVE tokens represent within the decentralized finance ecosystem. Both are fundamental components, each serving distinct yet vital roles: LDO (Lido DAO Token): LDO is the governance token of Lido DAO, the leading liquid staking protocol. Lido allows users to stake their Ethereum (ETH) and other proof-of-stake (PoS) assets while retaining liquidity through a tokenized version of their staked assets (e.g., stETH). This solves the liquidity lock-up problem associated with traditional staking, making it an attractive option for yield-seeking investors. Hayes’ investment in LDO could signal a bullish outlook on the continued growth of liquid staking derivatives and the broader Ethereum ecosystem. AAVE (Aave Protocol Token): AAVE is the native governance token of the Aave Protocol, one of the largest decentralized lending and borrowing platforms. Aave enables users to lend out their crypto assets to earn interest or borrow assets by providing collateral. It supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies and offers innovative features like flash loans. Investing in AAVE suggests a belief in the sustained demand for decentralized credit markets and the utility of on-chain lending solutions. Together, these tokens represent key facets of DeFi – efficient capital utilization through staking and robust, permissionless financial services through lending. Hayes’ dual investment highlights a diversified bet on these core functionalities. Why Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Continues to Attract Big Players The fact that Arthur Hayes chose two prominent Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols for his latest investment underscores the growing maturity and appeal of this sector. DeFi offers a compelling alternative to traditional finance, characterized by transparency, accessibility, and innovation. Here’s why it’s a magnet for influential investors: Benefits of DeFi: Permissionless Access: Anyone with an internet connection can participate, regardless of geographical location or financial status. Transparency: All transactions are recorded on public blockchains, fostering trust and reducing the need for intermediaries. Innovation: DeFi protocols are constantly evolving, introducing new financial primitives like liquid staking, flash loans, and decentralized exchanges. Yield Opportunities: Users can earn passive income through lending, staking, and providing liquidity. Challenges in DeFi: Smart Contract Risks: Vulnerabilities in code can lead to hacks and loss of funds. Volatility: The underlying crypto assets are highly volatile, impacting the value of borrowed and lent assets. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape poses challenges for widespread adoption. Scalability Issues: Some blockchains struggle with high transaction fees and slow speeds during peak demand. Despite these challenges, the long-term vision of an open, global financial system powered by blockchain technology remains a powerful draw. Hayes’ move reinforces the narrative that DeFi is not just a niche but a significant, evolving force in the financial world. Analyzing Crypto Market Trends Through Hayes’ Lens Arthur Hayes’ recent $2 million allocation to LDO and AAVE offers a fascinating lens through which to analyze current crypto market trends . His investment could be interpreted as a bullish signal for several key areas: Resilience of Core DeFi: While the crypto market has seen its share of volatility, this investment suggests a belief in the fundamental utility and long-term value of established DeFi protocols. It indicates that strong projects with proven use cases are likely to endure and thrive. The Staking Economy’s Growth: The significant investment in LDO highlights the increasing importance of the staking economy, especially post-Ethereum’s Merge. Liquid staking solutions are becoming integral for users looking to earn yield without sacrificing flexibility. Demand for Decentralized Credit: The AAVE investment points to a continued demand for decentralized lending and borrowing, underscoring the need for transparent, permissionless credit markets that operate outside traditional financial institutions. Institutional or Whale Confidence: When a well-known figure like Hayes makes such a public move (via on-chain data), it can influence sentiment and potentially attract further capital into these specific sectors, contributing to broader market recovery or growth. This move isn’t just about the tokens themselves; it’s about the underlying infrastructure and services they provide, which are increasingly seen as essential building blocks for the future of finance. The Power of On-chain Data in Revealing Strategic Moves The revelation of Arthur Hayes’ purchase was made possible by on-chain data analysis, specifically highlighted by @EmberCN. This demonstrates the unparalleled transparency and insights offered by public blockchains. Unlike traditional finance, where large transactions can often remain opaque, every movement of digital assets on a blockchain is publicly recorded and verifiable. This transparency is a double-edged sword: it allows for incredible scrutiny and real-time insights into market dynamics, but also means that strategic moves by whales and influential figures are immediately visible. Key Aspects of On-chain Data Analysis: Transparency: All transactions are immutable and publicly accessible. Real-time Insights: Analysts can track large transfers, whale movements, and smart contract interactions as they happen. Market Sentiment Indicators: Aggregated on-chain data can reveal broader market sentiment, accumulation/distribution trends, and potential price movements. Enhanced Due Diligence: Investors can verify holdings, transaction history, and smart contract activity. Hayes’ transaction, specifically the transfer from Flowdesk, was identified through these on-chain analytics tools, underscoring their growing importance for investors, researchers, and even regulatory bodies looking to understand the flow of capital in the crypto ecosystem. It provides a level of verifiable intelligence that is simply not available in traditional markets. What Does This Mean for You? Actionable Insights While Arthur Hayes’ investment is a significant event, it’s crucial for individual investors to consider their own strategies. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t just follow whale movements blindly. Understand the fundamentals of LDO, AAVE, and other DeFi protocols. Evaluate their technology, team, community, and long-term roadmap. Understand Risk: Crypto investments, especially in DeFi, carry inherent risks including smart contract vulnerabilities, impermanent loss, and market volatility. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Diversify: While Hayes focused on two tokens, a diversified portfolio across different sectors (e.g., Layer 1s, DeFi, NFTs, GameFi) can help mitigate risk. Stay Informed: Follow reputable on-chain analysts and news sources to keep abreast of market developments and influential investor activities. Consider Long-Term Trends: Hayes’ investment appears to be a long-term bet on core DeFi infrastructure. Evaluate if this aligns with your own investment horizon and thesis. This event serves as a reminder that even in a volatile market, conviction in strong, fundamental projects can lead to significant capital allocation by seasoned investors. The Road Ahead: What’s Next for LDO, AAVE, and DeFi? Arthur Hayes’ endorsement of LDO and AAVE could certainly bring renewed attention and potentially capital to these projects. As the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector continues to mature, the focus will likely remain on: Security and Audits: Enhancing smart contract security to prevent hacks and build user trust. Regulatory Clarity: As governments worldwide grapple with crypto regulation, clearer guidelines could foster greater institutional adoption. User Experience: Simplifying DeFi interfaces and reducing gas fees to make it more accessible to mainstream users. Interoperability: Seamless interaction between different blockchains and DeFi protocols. The continuous evolution of these protocols, combined with strategic investments from influential figures, will shape the trajectory of DeFi and its integration into the broader financial landscape. Conclusion: A Powerful Signal for Decentralized Finance Arthur Hayes’ substantial investment of $1 million each into LDO AAVE tokens is far more than just a transaction; it’s a powerful signal. It underscores a profound belief in the enduring value and future potential of core Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols. This strategic move, revealed through meticulous on-chain data analysis, offers valuable insights into current crypto market trends and the areas where influential figures see significant growth. While the crypto landscape remains dynamic and unpredictable, Hayes’ vote of confidence in liquid staking and decentralized lending reinforces the narrative that robust, utility-driven projects are poised for long-term success. As the DeFi ecosystem continues to evolve, such high-profile endorsements serve to validate its progress and attract further attention, potentially paving the way for the next wave of innovation and adoption.

        "BODY": "BitcoinWorld Argentina Peso Crisis: Unraveling Milei’s Bold Economic Reforms For anyone tracking the pulse of global finance, the unfolding drama in Argentina offers a stark reminder of the volatile nature of traditional currencies. As the Argentina Peso Crisis deepens, it naturally sparks conversations within the cryptocurrency community about the role of decentralized assets in times of economic turmoil. The nation, long grappling with economic instability, is now navigating the turbulent waters of radical economic change under President Javier Milei. His administration’s ambitious plans, intended to shock the economy back to health, are showing significant signs of strain, putting immense pressure on the national currency and the livelihoods of millions. Argentina’s economic narrative is a complex tapestry woven with threads of recurring crises, high inflation, and persistent debt. For decades, the country has struggled to achieve sustainable growth, often resorting to currency controls and cycles of borrowing and default. When Javier Milei, a self-proclaimed anarcho-capitalist, swept into power in December 2023, he promised a dramatic departure from past policies. His ‘shock therapy’ approach aimed to dismantle the state’s role in the economy, slash public spending, and liberalize markets. The initial optimism, however, is now being tested by the harsh realities of implementation, as the peso continues its precarious dance against global currencies. Unveiling Javier Milei’s Bold Vision: What Do His Milei Economic Reforms Entail? President Milei’s economic blueprint is nothing short of revolutionary for Argentina. His core philosophy centers on drastically reducing state intervention, promoting free markets, and achieving fiscal surplus through aggressive spending cuts. The package of Milei Economic Reforms introduced upon his inauguration included a massive devaluation of the official peso, significant cuts to energy and transport subsidies, deregulation of various industries, and a push towards privatization of state-owned enterprises. He also floated the idea of dollarizing the economy, though this particular measure has faced considerable hurdles and has not been fully implemented. The intention behind these reforms is clear: to eliminate the fiscal deficit, curb hyperinflation, and stabilize the economy. Milei’s supporters argue that these painful adjustments are necessary to lay a foundation for long-term growth and attract foreign investment. They believe that only through such drastic measures can Argentina break free from its cycles of boom and bust. However, the immediate impact has been a sharp increase in poverty and a contraction of economic activity, as businesses and consumers grapple with the sudden changes. Key pillars of Milei’s reform agenda include: Fiscal Austerity: Drastic cuts to public spending, aiming for a ‘zero deficit’ target. This involves reducing subsidies for utilities and transportation, impacting household budgets directly. Deregulation: Eliminating numerous government regulations across various sectors, from labor markets to rental agreements, with the goal of fostering competition and efficiency. Privatization: Plans to sell off state-owned companies, including national airline Aerolíneas Argentinas and oil company YPF, to reduce state expenditure and improve service delivery. Monetary Policy Shift: A commitment to end the central bank’s money printing, which Milei blames for inflation, and to accumulate foreign reserves. While these reforms are designed to address deep-seated structural issues, their implementation has been met with significant social and political resistance. Protests have erupted, and the government faces an uphill battle in passing legislation through a fragmented Congress, highlighting the immense challenges in transforming a deeply entrenched economic system. The Price of Reform: Why is Currency Devaluation Argentina ‘s Immediate Reality? One of the most immediate and impactful steps taken by the Milei administration was a sharp devaluation of the official peso against the U.S. dollar. This measure, aimed at narrowing the gap between the official and black-market exchange rates and making Argentine exports more competitive, has had profound consequences. The initial Currency Devaluation Argentina experienced saw the official exchange rate jump from around 365 pesos per dollar to 800 pesos per dollar overnight, effectively halving the currency’s value for many transactions. This dramatic shift has a dual effect. For exporters, it theoretically makes their goods cheaper and more attractive on the international market, boosting foreign currency earnings. However, for ordinary Argentinians, the devaluation has been devastating. The cost of imported goods, from electronics to medicines, has skyrocketed. Essential items, many of which rely on imported components or raw materials, have become significantly more expensive, eroding the purchasing power of wages and savings. The devaluation also fuels inflationary pressures, as businesses pass on increased import costs to consumers. While the government hopes this is a one-time adjustment that will eventually stabilize the economy, the immediate pain is palpable. The gap between the official and various parallel exchange rates (such as the ‘blue dollar’ or ‘MEP dollar’) still persists, albeit narrowed, reflecting ongoing market skepticism and the public’s desire to protect their wealth in more stable currencies, primarily the U.S. dollar. The impact of this currency adjustment can be summarized: Erosion of Savings: Savings held in pesos rapidly lose value, pushing more people towards foreign currencies or alternative assets. Increased Cost of Living: Prices for a wide range of goods and services, particularly those with imported components, rise sharply. Export Competitiveness: Theoretically improves, but depends on global demand and other economic factors. Debt Burden: Increases the peso value of dollar-denominated debt for individuals and businesses without dollar income. The challenge for Argentina now is to manage the aftermath of this devaluation without triggering an uncontrollable spiral of prices and further economic contraction. The effectiveness of this move hinges on the government’s ability to control inflation and restore confidence in the peso over the medium term. The Relentless Beast: Can Argentina Tame Rampant Inflation in Argentina ? Perhaps the most pressing economic challenge facing Argentina is its persistently high inflation. For years, the country has battled triple-digit inflation rates, a phenomenon that deeply impacts daily life, erodes trust in the national currency, and complicates economic planning for businesses and households alike. The current wave of Inflation in Argentina has reached levels not seen in decades, with monthly figures often in the double digits, translating to annual rates well over 200%. This hyperinflationary environment is a direct consequence of decades of fiscal deficits financed by money printing, coupled with a lack of investor confidence and structural economic imbalances. The recent peso devaluation, while intended to correct imbalances, has exacerbated inflationary pressures in the short term, as import costs are immediately passed on to consumers. Supermarket prices change almost daily, making budgeting nearly impossible for families and forcing businesses to constantly adjust their pricing strategies. The government’s primary tool to combat inflation is its aggressive fiscal austerity program, aiming to stop the central bank from printing money to finance government spending. While this is a critical step, the transmission mechanism from fiscal cuts to lower inflation takes time, and the immediate social cost is high. Many Argentinians are struggling to make ends meet, with real wages failing to keep pace with the relentless rise in prices. This situation fuels social unrest and tests the resilience of the population. Understanding the impact of inflation: Purchasing Power Erosion: Money saved or earned quickly loses its value, discouraging long-term financial planning. Economic Uncertainty: Businesses hesitate to invest, and consumers defer purchases, leading to a slowdown in economic activity. Informal Economy Growth: People increasingly turn to unofficial channels and foreign currencies to protect their wealth. Social Strain: Rising poverty, increased inequality, and potential for widespread protests as living standards decline. Taming inflation is not merely an economic objective; it is a social imperative. Success in this area is crucial for Milei’s administration to maintain public support and demonstrate the viability of his radical economic vision. The path ahead remains fraught with challenges, as historical patterns of high inflation are difficult to break without significant sacrifices. Navigating the Storm: What’s the Long-Term Argentine Economy Outlook ? The long-term Argentine Economy Outlook under Milei’s reforms is a subject of intense debate among economists, investors, and citizens. While the immediate picture is one of contraction and hardship, the government maintains that these painful adjustments are necessary for a healthier, more stable future. The success of these reforms hinges on several critical factors, including political stability, public patience, and the ability to attract significant foreign investment. In the short term, Argentina is likely to experience a recession as the economy adjusts to the fiscal shock and high inflation. Consumer spending is down, and businesses are facing reduced demand and increased costs. However, if the government successfully curbs inflation and achieves fiscal balance, it could eventually restore confidence among international creditors and investors. This renewed trust could lead to lower borrowing costs, increased foreign direct investment, and a more stable economic environment. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) plays a crucial role in Argentina’s financial stability, given the country’s substantial debt obligations. The IMF has expressed cautious support for Milei’s efforts to stabilize the economy, but continued disbursements of funds depend on Argentina meeting its fiscal targets and implementing structural reforms. The path to debt sustainability is long and complex, requiring sustained effort and political consensus. Key considerations for the future: Political Will: Can Milei maintain the necessary political support to push through unpopular reforms? Social Cohesion: Will the population endure the short-term pain for potential long-term gain, or will social unrest derail the agenda? Investment Inflow: Can Argentina attract the foreign capital needed to stimulate growth and create jobs? Global Economic Environment: Favorable commodity prices and a stable global financial landscape would aid recovery. The Argentine economy stands at a crossroads. The reforms are a high-stakes gamble. If successful, they could set the country on a path of sustainable growth and financial stability. If they falter, Argentina risks deepening its economic crisis and further isolating itself from global markets. The world watches closely, as the outcome could offer valuable lessons for other nations grappling with similar economic woes. Crypto’s Role in Turbulent Times: Actionable Insights from Argentina Amidst the traditional financial turmoil, Argentina offers a compelling case study for the utility and adoption of cryptocurrencies. For years, Argentinians have been at the forefront of crypto adoption, not out of speculative interest but out of necessity. Facing constant currency devaluation and capital controls, many have turned to digital assets as a hedge against inflation and a means to preserve wealth. Stablecoins , pegged to the U.S. dollar like USDT or DAI, have become particularly popular. They offer a way for citizens to hold value in a more stable currency without the complexities and risks associated with holding physical dollars. Bitcoin, too, is seen by many as a long-term store of value, a ‘digital gold’ that is immune to government interference and inflationary policies. Local crypto exchanges and peer-to-peer trading platforms thrive, facilitating transactions and providing an alternative financial rail for individuals and businesses. The Argentine experience provides several actionable insights for individuals and investors globally: Inflation Hedge: In environments of high inflation, cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins and Bitcoin, can serve as a robust hedge against the erosion of purchasing power. Financial Freedom: For those in countries with strict capital controls or unstable banking systems, crypto offers a means of moving and storing value independently. Market Signals: Observing crypto adoption trends in economically distressed nations can provide early signals of systemic financial instability and the public’s loss of faith in traditional systems. Decentralization’s Value: The crisis underscores the fundamental value proposition of decentralized finance – providing alternatives when centralized systems fail or become unreliable. While the broader economic reforms in Argentina continue to unfold, the growing reliance on cryptocurrencies highlights a significant shift in how individuals are protecting their financial futures. It underscores that for many, crypto is not just an investment, but a vital tool for economic survival and resilience. A Nation at the Crossroads: The Unpredictable Journey Ahead Argentina’s economic journey under President Milei is a bold experiment with high stakes. The Argentina Peso Crisis , the sweeping Milei Economic Reforms , the ongoing Currency Devaluation Argentina faces, and the persistent challenge of Inflation in Argentina all paint a picture of a nation undergoing a profound transformation. While the immediate future promises continued hardship and uncertainty, the administration hopes that these radical measures will eventually pave the way for long-term stability and prosperity. The success of this ambitious plan hinges on the government’s ability to navigate political opposition, maintain social cohesion, and attract the necessary foreign investment to fuel recovery. For the global financial community, Argentina serves as a critical case study, demonstrating both the perils of economic mismanagement and the potential, albeit painful, pathways to reform. The long-term Argentine Economy Outlook remains uncertain, but the lessons learned from this period will undoubtedly resonate far beyond its borders, especially for those who see decentralized currencies as a viable alternative in an increasingly volatile world.

        "BODY": "Mark Zuckerberg and other Meta executives have put an end to the $8 billion Cambridge Analytica privacy lawsuit with a settlement. Meta decided to avoid drawing the kind of attention that allowing the privacy scandal to go to trial would have had by settling with the suing shareholders. Shareholders hit board members with $8B privacy lawsuit Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other top executives, including the company’s former COO, Sheryl Sandberg, have agreed to settle a major shareholder lawsuit over the company’s mishandling of user data during the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The lawsuit, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, sought $8 billion in damages and accused the company leaders of intentionally failing to uphold privacy commitments mandated by federal regulators. A lawyer representing one of the plaintiffs confirmed that a settlement had been reached “in principle” with Meta and its executives. With an agreement in place, the high-profile trial in Delaware, where Zuckerberg had been expected to testify, is now over. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed during Thursday’s court proceedings, and attorneys for both sides have yet to provide public comments about it. The lawsuit was based on allegations that Meta executives deliberately failed to comply with a 2012 consent decree issued by the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), which required the company to strengthen its privacy practices. According to the shareholders, Meta’s failure to adhere to that order directly led to significant legal and financial consequences, including a $5.1 million payment to the FTC and damage to the company’s reputation, which then affected the company’s value. Shareholders had asked the court to order Zuckerberg, Sandberg, and other executives to repay Meta for the losses they claim stemmed from this mismanagement. By reaching a settlement, Meta avoids paying more attention to its long-standing privacy issues. Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal In 2018, there were revelations that the political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, harvested the personal data of millions of Facebook users without their consent. The firm then used that data to support Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Facebook experienced intense backlash, leading to Zuckerberg appearing multiple times before Congress and raising scrutiny and concern over Facebook’s data policies. The FTC subsequently sued Meta, formerly known as Facebook Inc., accusing the company of ignoring “red flags” about how Cambridge Analytica obtained the data. Regulators argued that Meta failed to properly monitor how third-party developers accessed user information, which they said violated the 2012 consent decree. Zuckerberg’s involvement in the decision-making process has been a central issue in the case. Plaintiffs alleged that he and other senior leaders knowingly allowed violations of the FTC’s consent order to continue, prioritizing user growth and engagement over proper safeguards. The complaint argued that the failure to follow protocol exposed the company to unnecessary regulatory and financial risk and saddled the shareholders with the cost. Meta did not admit wrongdoing in the FTC case, but it paid $5.1M to resolve the claims. In the years since, Meta has made repeated promises to overhaul its privacy practices, including restructuring its approach to data collection and expanding its internal compliance teams. But for many investors, those measures have not gone far enough. The shareholder suit in Delaware represents one of the most serious legal efforts to hold individual executives accountable for the fallout from Cambridge Analytica.

        "BODY": "Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have crossed the $5.5 billion threshold in inflows since their debut, with more than $3.3 billion flowing into these Ether investment vehicles since mid-April alone. Bloomberg ETF Analyst James Seyffart disclosed in a July 17 X post that these substantial inflows stem primarily from the basis yield on Ethereum, which has climbed back into double-digit territory for the first time since December 2024, alongside increased open interest in CME Ethereum futures contracts. Part of this is almost certainly from the Basis yield on Ethereum jumping back up and into double digits but its definitely not the whole story pic.twitter.com/rXAAOIGLZH — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) July 17, 2025 Ethereum’s valuation has responded favorably to this institutional purchasing pressure, reaching a six-month high of $3,481.58 before stabilizing at around $3,427 at the time of publication. BlackRock’s ETHA Dominates Ethereum ETFs Record Inflows With $489M Single-Day Buy According to SosoValue data , BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) emerged as the primary catalyst, achieving its strongest performance ever with $489 million in inflows on July 17.

BlackRock’s current Ethereum holdings now total $6.94 billion USD. The momentum extended beyond BlackRock’s offering. Collectively, all U.S. Ethereum ETFs registered record daily inflows of $726.74 million , surpassing the previous benchmark of $430 million. Source: SosoValue Fidelity’s FETH contributed $113.31 million, while Grayscale’s mini trust added $54.18 million, both achieving their strongest performance in months. Supply-Demand Dynamics: ETFs Control 4.02% of Total Ethereum Market Cap With ETFs currently managing 5 million ETH (representing 4.02% of Ethereum’s $413 billion market capitalization), demand strongly exceeds available supply. Ethereum-focused treasuries hold $5.3 billion worth of ETH and are acquiring tokens at a rate 36 times the daily ETH production rate. Additionally, ETH investment funds have maintained 12 consecutive weeks of positive inflows, including $996 million in the most recent week alone.

President Trump-affiliated World Liberty Financial (WLFI) has also recently acquired $4.99 million worth of ETH. While Ethereum lacks Bitcoin’s scarcity characteristics, potentially diminishing its store-of-value proposition, its staking reward capability makes institutional adoption particularly appealing to certain firms. New SEC crypto guidance just dropped: certain staking activities aren't securities transactions — but not everyone’s on board. https://t.co/Igzg1Nm7zX — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 30, 2025 With the SEC apparently relaxing its stance on staking-as-a-service enforcement , companies are increasingly comfortable incorporating ETH staking into their treasury strategies without regulatory concerns. Analysts Signal $4,000 Price Target Crypto investor and OKX exchange partner Ted Pillows notes that ETH is following a similar trajectory to the 2016-17 market cycle. History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes. $ETH is following the same path as the 2016-17 cycle. Just the breakout above $4,000 and you'll see an even bigger rally. pic.twitter.com/ckwNXo7g19 — Ted (@TedPillows) July 17, 2025 Following the recent $3,200 breakout, he anticipates a $4,000 price recovery in the near term, followed by a more substantial rally thereafter. Prominent market maker Wintermute has also indicated that minimal ETH remains available through OTC desks, suggesting demand is overwhelming supply. When such conditions emerge, price movements typically accelerate rapidly, which many view as another catalyst supporting the $4,000 target. Technical Analysis: Rising Channel Confirms Bullish Structure The ETH/USD chart displays upward momentum supported by an ascending channel formation. Following a decisive breakout within the channel, Ethereum is currently experiencing minor consolidation below the $3,519 resistance level. Source: TradingView Price action maintains position above the Ichimoku cloud, indicating bullish momentum and underlying support, with the cloud providing a foundation around $3,200. Technical analysis suggests two potential scenarios: a brief retracement toward the previous breakout zone (approximately $3,400), followed by a recovery, or a direct continuation to challenge the $3,519–$3,664 resistance range. Ethereum 9.65% away from massive 4-year breakout targeting $3,500 before weekend as BlackRock accumulates $5B and Sharplink explodes to $974M ETH portfolio dominance. #Ethereum #ETH https://t.co/2EiTKiqcHW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 16, 2025 Provided the price remains above the cloud and the ascending channel structure holds, the bullish perspective remains valid, with probable targets around $3,650–$3,664 in the short term. A sustained breach below $3,300 would threaten the bullish configuration and potentially reactivate the $3,100 support zone.

        "BODY": "BitcoinWorld Digital Ruble Set to Revolutionize Russian Payments by 2026: A Major Shift The financial world is constantly evolving, and a significant tremor has just been felt from Russia. A groundbreaking law has been approved, mandating the rollout of the digital ruble and universal QR payments across the nation, with a firm start date of September 1, 2026. This isn’t just another payment update; it’s a foundational shift that could redefine how money moves within the Russian financial system , echoing ripples across the global economic landscape. What is the Digital Ruble and Why is Russia Embracing it Now? For those familiar with the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies, the term ‘digital currency’ might conjure images of Bitcoin or Ethereum. However, the digital ruble is fundamentally different. It’s a form of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), meaning it’s issued and backed by the Central Bank of Russia, just like physical cash or traditional bank deposits. Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies, a CBDC is centralized and represents a direct liability of the central bank. So, why is Russia pushing for this now? The motivations are multifaceted, blending economic efficiency with strategic autonomy. For years, nations have explored CBDCs to modernize their payment infrastructure, reduce transaction costs, enhance financial inclusion, and gain greater control over monetary policy. For Russia, these benefits are amplified by its unique geopolitical context. A state-backed digital currency can offer a more resilient and independent payment system, potentially mitigating the impact of external financial pressures and sanctions. It’s a move towards bolstering financial sovereignty and innovation within the Russian financial system . Unpacking the Universal QR Payments Mandate: A Seamless Future? Alongside the digital ruble, the new law introduces a universal QR payments code. This is a crucial element of the grand design, aiming to simplify and standardize digital transactions across the board. Imagine a single QR code that works everywhere, regardless of your bank or the merchant’s bank. That’s the vision. Standardization: The mandate requires all banks and merchants to join the digital ruble platform and utilize this universal QR code. This means an end to fragmented payment systems where different apps or codes are needed for various merchants. Ease of Use: For consumers, making payments will become incredibly straightforward. Simply scan the universal QR code with your smartphone, confirm the amount, and the transaction is complete. No Client Fees: A particularly attractive feature is that banks cannot charge clients for using this QR code. This incentivizes adoption and reduces the cost of digital transactions for everyday users, making the digital ruble an appealing option for domestic transfers. Facilitating Digital Ruble Transfers: The QR code is designed to be the primary interface for initiating and receiving digital ruble transactions, ensuring widespread usability for the new currency. This universal approach to QR payments is a clear signal that Russia intends to create a highly integrated and efficient digital payment ecosystem, making the transition to the digital ruble as smooth as possible for its citizens and businesses. The Ambitious Rollout: A Phased Approach to Russia CBDC Implementing a nationwide digital currency system is no small feat. Recognizing the complexity, Russia has outlined a phased rollout strategy to ensure a stable and successful transition for its Russia CBDC initiative. According to Interfax, the timeline is clear: Phase Timeline Participants Key Action Phase 1 Starting September 1, 2026 Major Banks & Merchants Must support digital ruble transactions and universal QR payments. Phase 2 By 2028 Smaller Banks Gradual integration into the digital ruble platform. This staggered approach allows major financial institutions to iron out any technical kinks and gather user feedback before the system is fully expanded. It’s a pragmatic way to manage the massive undertaking of integrating a new form of money into the existing Russian financial system . The initial focus on major banks ensures that a significant portion of the population and commercial activity is covered from the outset, paving the way for broader adoption. How Will This Impact the Central Bank Digital Currency Landscape? Russia’s move into the realm of Central Bank Digital Currency is part of a broader global trend, yet it carries unique implications. While countries like China have already launched their digital yuan, and the European Central Bank is actively exploring a digital euro, Russia’s geopolitical position adds a distinct layer to its CBDC strategy. Globally, CBDCs are seen as a way for central banks to retain relevance in an increasingly digital world, offer a sovereign alternative to private digital currencies, and enhance the efficiency of payment systems. Russia’s digital ruble could serve as a blueprint or a cautionary tale for other nations considering similar paths, particularly those seeking greater financial autonomy. The development of a robust Russia CBDC system could also influence discussions around cross-border CBDC payments, though initial focus will undoubtedly be on domestic use. As more countries explore or implement their own digital currencies, the potential for new international payment corridors and agreements becomes a fascinating area to watch. Navigating the Future: Benefits and Challenges for the Russian Financial System The introduction of the digital ruble and universal QR payments holds significant promise for the Russian financial system , but like any major technological and regulatory overhaul, it comes with its own set of challenges. Key Benefits: Enhanced Efficiency: Instantaneous settlements, 24/7 availability, and reduced intermediaries can make payments faster and more streamlined. Reduced Costs: Eliminating certain fees and the need for physical cash handling can lower operational costs for banks and businesses, potentially benefiting consumers through lower transaction fees. Financial Inclusion: A digital currency can reach unbanked or underbanked populations more easily, provided they have access to a smartphone and basic digital literacy. Monetary Policy Control: The central bank gains greater visibility and potentially more granular control over money supply and circulation, allowing for more targeted economic interventions. Resilience and Sovereignty: A domestically controlled digital payment system offers a degree of insulation from external pressures and strengthens national financial independence. Potential Challenges: Privacy Concerns: As a centralized digital currency, transactions on the digital ruble platform could be traceable by the central bank, raising questions about individual privacy. Public Adoption: Overcoming inertia and building public trust in a new form of money will be critical. Education and seamless user experience will be key. Technological Infrastructure: Ensuring the robustness, scalability, and security of the underlying technology to handle nationwide transactions without glitches is a monumental task. Cybersecurity Risks: A centralized digital system presents a single point of failure that could be targeted by cyberattacks, necessitating top-tier security measures. Impact on Commercial Banks: There’s a potential for disintermediation, as some functions traditionally performed by commercial banks might shift to the central bank, requiring banks to adapt their business models. The success of this initiative will hinge on how effectively Russia navigates these challenges while maximizing the inherent benefits for its economy and citizens. It’s a delicate balance between innovation, control, and user acceptance. What Does This Mean for the Crypto World and Beyond? For enthusiasts of decentralized cryptocurrencies, the rise of CBDCs like the digital ruble often sparks debate. While both are digital, their fundamental philosophies diverge. Cryptocurrencies champion decentralization, anonymity (to varying degrees), and freedom from central authority. CBDCs, conversely, represent the ultimate form of centralized digital money, reinforcing the power of the state’s financial institutions. This move by Russia underscores a global trend: governments are increasingly embracing digital money, but on their own terms. It’s less about adopting blockchain’s decentralized ethos and more about digitizing fiat currency for efficiency and control. This could lead to a future where CBDCs coexist with, or even compete with, private digital payment systems and traditional banking. It highlights the growing digital transformation of money, pushing both traditional finance and the crypto space to adapt. The approval of the digital ruble and universal QR payments marks a pivotal moment for Russia. By 2026, the nation is poised to operate a modern, efficient, and centrally controlled digital payment system. This ambitious undertaking aims to strengthen the Russian financial system , enhance its resilience, and offer its citizens a seamless way to transact.

        "BODY": "BitMine Immersion Technologies, a Bitcoin-focused technology company, has purchased 300,657 Ethereum (ETH), worth about $1 billion at the current market price of $3,461.89 per ETH. According to the announcement, this significant purchase reflects the company’s belief in Ethereum’s long-term value and the increasing interest from institutions in digital assets. BitMine Focuses on Building an Ethereum Treasury On July 8, BitMine completed a $250 million private placement, which allowed the company to expand its cryptocurrency holdings. With this, the company grows its digital assets without making significant investments in physical assets. Meanwhile, Peter Thiel, a well-known tech billionaire and venture capitalist, has purchased a 9.1% stake in BitMine. This move boosts the company’s credibility and investor confidence. Notably, BitMine is focused on building an Ethereum treasury. This aligns with current market trends that see ETH value for its flexibility and its role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3. BitMine’s decision strengthens the company’s financial position and shows that Ethereum is becoming an essential investment for institutional investors. Ethereum Whales’ Continuous ETH Accumulation As reported by TheCoinRise, the largest Ethereum holders are quietly building their positions. According to a June report, wallets holding between 1,000 and 100,000 ETH have accumulated 1.49 million ETH worth $3.79 billion . This marks a 3.72% increase in their collective holdings, which now total about 41.61 million ETH. While whales continue accumulating, institutional interest in ETH has also increased. Over $528 million entered spot ETH exchange-traded funds some weeks ago. Ethereum futures open interest also surged to $41 billion, a significant show of confidence from traders. As of the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,420.25, a 6% increase in the past 24 hours. Expanding Portfolio in the Crypto Space Recall that Peter Thiel invested $200 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2023 before the bullish run. The Founders Fund leader has been expanding its portfolio to include a diverse range of cryptocurrency startups. Leveraging its expertise and experience in identifying disruptive technologies, the firm has invested in companies like Ondo Finance and Layer N, among others. This diversified approach reflects Peter’s commitment to staying at the forefront of innovation in the crypto space. By backing promising startups across various segments of the industry , the tech billionaire aims to capitalize on emerging trends and technologies.

        "BODY": "BitcoinWorld Memecoin Market Cap Explodes: A Phenomenal $17 Billion Surge This Month The world of digital assets is constantly evolving, and this month, one sector has truly stolen the spotlight: memecoins. What was once considered a niche, speculative corner of the cryptocurrency landscape has now demonstrated a truly astounding display of resilience and growth. We’re witnessing a remarkable phenomenon as the overall memecoin market cap has soared by nearly $17 billion, reaching an impressive $72 billion. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it represents a significant 29% increase from the $55 billion recorded at the end of June, according to data from CoinMarketCap, as reported by Cointelegraph. This explosive growth is captivating investors and enthusiasts alike, prompting many to ask: what’s fueling this sudden and powerful rally? What’s Driving This Astounding Memecoin Market Cap Surge? The recent surge in the memecoin market cap isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several factors appear to be converging, creating a perfect storm for these often-volatile assets. While memecoins are known for their community-driven nature and viral appeal, their recent performance suggests deeper market dynamics at play. One of the primary catalysts, as noted by Cointelegraph, is the price rallies observed in foundational cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). When major cryptocurrencies experience upward momentum, it often creates a ripple effect across the broader altcoin market, with memecoins often benefiting disproportionately due to their high beta characteristics. Furthermore, increased trading volume across the board indicates a renewed interest and liquidity flowing into the sector. This isn’t just about price appreciation; it’s about more participants entering the market, more trades being executed, and a general increase in activity. This heightened engagement suggests that investors are once again looking towards higher-risk, higher-reward assets, possibly in anticipation of a broader market uptrend or simply a desire to capitalize on the rapid gains memecoins can offer. Spotlight on Top Performers: Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe Coin While the entire memecoin sector is experiencing a boom, certain key players are leading the charge. The titans of the memecoin world, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), have once again demonstrated their significant market presence. Both have shown substantial gains over the past week, reaffirming their status as investor favorites within this volatile asset class. But they aren’t alone; Pepe Coin (PEPE), a relatively newer entrant that captured significant attention earlier this year, has also contributed meaningfully to the overall growth. Let’s take a closer look at some of the major memecoin movements: Memecoin Recent Performance (Past Week) Notes Dogecoin (DOGE) Significant Gains The original memecoin, strong community backing. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Significant Gains Known for its ecosystem development (Shibarium). Pepe Coin (PEPE) Significant Gains Recent viral sensation, no intrinsic value claims. These gains are not just about price; they are indicative of renewed investor confidence and speculative interest flowing back into these highly liquid assets. The sheer volume of trading suggests that both retail and potentially institutional players are re-engaging with the memecoin phenomenon. Beyond the Giants: The Remarkable Rise of Floki, Pudgy Penguins, and Bonk While Dogecoin , Shiba Inu , and Pepe Coin often grab the headlines, the recent market movements show that the momentum extends far beyond these established names. Smaller, yet highly influential, memecoins have also posted incredible gains in trading volume, signaling a broadening of interest across the sector. Floki (FLOKI), Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), and Bonk (BONK) have all witnessed staggering increases in trading volume, ranging between 45% and 72%. This suggests that the speculative fervor is not concentrated in just a few assets but is spreading to a wider array of memecoin projects. This expansion of interest is a crucial indicator. It points to a broader bullish sentiment for memecoins, where investors are willing to explore projects with smaller market caps but potentially higher growth ceilings. These tokens, often tied to specific communities or narratives, can experience rapid price swings fueled by social media trends and viral marketing. Navigating the Volatile Crypto Market: Benefits and Challenges of Memecoin Investing The recent surge in the crypto market growth , particularly within the memecoin sector, presents both exciting opportunities and significant challenges for investors. The primary benefit, undoubtedly, is the potential for exponential returns. As we’ve seen with the $17 billion increase in memecoin market cap, these assets can deliver gains that are rarely seen in traditional markets. They offer accessibility to a wide range of investors, often at very low entry points per token, making them appealing for those looking for high-risk, high-reward plays. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent challenges. Memecoins are notoriously volatile. Their prices are often driven by sentiment, social media trends, and celebrity endorsements rather than fundamental utility or technology. This makes them highly susceptible to rapid price corrections. What goes up quickly can come down even faster. Liquidity can also be a concern for smaller memecoins, making it difficult to enter or exit positions without impacting the price. The lack of clear use cases for many memecoins also means their long-term viability is often questionable compared to projects with defined roadmaps and technological innovations. Key Considerations for Investors: High Volatility: Be prepared for significant price swings. Community-Driven: Understand that sentiment and social trends heavily influence price. Research is Key: Even for memecoins, understanding the project’s community, development (if any), and overall market sentiment is vital. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio. What Does This Memecoin Resurgence Mean for the Future of Crypto? The phenomenal surge in the memecoin market cap is more than just a passing trend; it reflects a broader sentiment within the cryptocurrency space. It indicates a renewed appetite for risk and speculative investments, often seen during periods of market optimism. This latest wave of growth, significantly boosted by the upward trajectory of major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Solana, highlights the interconnectedness of the crypto ecosystem. While memecoins may lack the fundamental utility of some other digital assets, their ability to capture public imagination and generate significant trading volume makes them an undeniable force in the market. This period of explosive growth could signal a broader resurgence for the entire crypto market, drawing new participants and capital. However, investors must proceed with caution, understanding that the very factors that drive memecoin prices sky-high—speculation and hype—can also lead to swift and severe downturns. The future remains uncertain, but for now, memecoins are enjoying their moment in the sun, proving once again that in the world of crypto, anything is possible.

        "BODY": "Russian bank Sberbank plans to offer custody services for the country’s crypto assets. With more foreign banks embracing crypto custody, Anatoly Pronin, the Executive Director of Sberbank’s Alternative Payment Solutions Department, said they presented a proposal to the central bank on domestic crypto asset regulation. Lately, Russia’s central bank has been more open to pro-crypto policies. Last year, they permitted companies to trade in crypto to bypass Western sanctions implemented due to the Ukraine war. Russia’s Sberbank says it wants to regulate digital assets like the funds in bank accounts At a crypto regulation discussion, Pronin explained that Sberbank would want to oversee crypto assets like it does customer deposits, to ensure token security . He added that their custody service would include mechanisms to freeze assets upon suspicion of illegal activity and promote secure, accessible user transactions. Russia’s central bank disclosed it would allow financial institutions to provide crypto investment products in late May. It detailed that the new rules would cover instruments, including derivatives and tokenized instruments, tied to crypto value changes. However, investors can only engage in non-deliverable contracts, meaning they can’t hold or receive cryptocurrencies. The bank also stated that financial institutions must follow a risk-averse assessment strategy before launching crypto instruments to avoid compromising financial stability. However, the CBR never specified whether it would allow crypto custody services. Sberbank came up with a workaround to bypass Western sanctions Sberbank has been trying to make transactions easier for its users. In June, the bank devised a workaround that routes wire transfers to European banks via intermediaries, avoiding Western sanctions and the SWIFT bans. The bank’s clients can now transfer rubles through its mobile app to European cardholders at Revolut or N26. However, on the recipient’s side, the transfers do not display Sberbank’s name; instead, they show the name of a individual, a regional city, or a payment processing entity. So far, about 500,000 rubles, roughly $6400, can be transferred per transaction to European banks, with a monthly threshold of 3 million rubles, worth about $38,200. However, both N26 and Revolut distanced themselves from the alleged transfer scheme, insisting they prohibit any transactions that contravene sanctions. N26 said it routinely conducts compliance assessments, and Revolut warned users that such activity could lead to account restrictions. Regardless, one of the bank’s staff remarked, “It’s not dangerous. The bank has always had transfers like that.” Sberbank moves to expand crypto access for elite Russian investors Just recently, Sberbank said it would become a market maker providing liquidity for regulated platforms that will give qualified Russian investors access to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, a high-ranking executive unveiled. In an interview with business news outlet RBC, the head of Sberbank’s Global Markets Department, Alexander Zozulya, praised the Bank of Russia’s “important step” to announce the development of an experimental legal regime (ELR) for crypto transactions and emphasized: “We expect the emergence of a legal ‘sandbox,’ an analogue of a regulated crypto platform, where super-qualified investors will be allowed to operate directly with cryptocurrencies.” Zozulya’s remarks followed recent comments by Central Bank of Russia (CBR) Governor Elvira Nabiullina, who acknowledged earlier this month that direct investment in crypto assets would necessitate regulatory reforms and the development of dedicated infrastructure. During her appearance at the “Russian Stock Market—2025” conference in mid-May, Nabiullina also clarified that such transactions should be carried out exclusively within the ELR framework and available only to “highly qualified” investors. In March, the Central Bank introduced the special regime and the “ highly qualified investors ” category. Under the ELR, Russian companies will be permitted to use and exchange cryptocurrencies in foreign trade, providing a way to sidestep restrictions linked to the war in Ukraine.

        "BODY": "The debate over XRP’s true all-time high (ATH) has resurfaced following a clarifying post by Dom (Bull/ish) of EasyA. Amid recent price surges and renewed market interest, Dom addressed growing confusion about XRP’s historical peak, quoting Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, to set the record straight. Clearing the Confusion: $3.36 vs $3.84 Many XRP followers have long believed that the token’s ATH was $3.84, a figure commonly displayed on several cryptocurrency tracking platforms. However, Dom revealed that the actual peak was $3.36, an insight grounded in a statement by Ripple’s CTO. In a post made on January 16, 2024, David Schwartz explained the discrepancy. “That is often reported as the all-time high,” he said, referring to the $3.84 figure. “But you could not actually sell XRP for $3.84, nor did you have to pay $3.84 to buy it. That number included inflated amounts due to the use of ‘official’ currency exchange rates for Korean exchange rates.” since many of you are rightly asking, ATH for $XRP is $3.36. (not $3.84 as some exchanges will show). https://t.co/CqsA5NYxgX — Dom (Bull/ish) | EasyA (@dom_kwok) July 17, 2025 Dom echoed this explanation in his recent X community post, stating, “Since many of you are rightly asking, ATH for XRP is $3.36. (Not $3.84 as some exchanges will show).” His comment highlights the importance of accurate, regionally-adjusted data in defining historical price benchmarks. The Role of the “Kimchi Premium” The inflated $3.84 figure stems from a phenomenon known as the “Kimchi premium,” which refers to unusually high prices for cryptocurrencies on South Korean exchanges during the 2017–2018 bull market. Due to capital controls and limited access to foreign exchanges, South Korean traders were often willing to pay a premium to acquire crypto assets, XRP included. Some price aggregators used “official” exchange rates for the South Korean won (KRW), which led to misleading conversions and exaggerated global averages. These inflated figures, while technically recorded, did not reflect the real trading environment for the vast majority of XRP holders and investors. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why $3.36 Is the More Accurate All-Time High Unlike the distorted $3.84 number, the $3.36 price point was the highest price XRP reached on major U.S. exchanges with consistent global liquidity. It reflects what traders could actually buy or sell XRP for, excluding anomalies caused by regional price disparities. As Dom rightly pointed out, understanding the authentic ATH is crucial, especially now that XRP has once again crossed the $3 threshold. As of mid-July 2025, XRP is trading at $3.26, up more than 10% in the past 24 hours, sparking conversations about whether a new ATH is imminent. Importance of Data Accuracy Amid Market Resurgence With XRP back in the spotlight due to regulatory clarity and growing institutional adoption, the need for precision in market history has become more important than ever. Investors, analysts, and researchers rely on historical benchmarks to assess potential growth and identify resistance levels. Misleading ATH figures can create confusion, misalign expectations, and distort technical analysis. Thanks to clarifications from Ripple CTO David Schwartz and amplifications by trusted voices like Dom, the XRP community now has a clearer, more accurate understanding of the token’s historical peak. This renewed accuracy helps position XRP for a more informed and transparent journey toward its next major milestone.

        "BODY": "Pakistan has moved closer to tapping El Salvador’s Bitcoin playbook. In San Salvador this week, Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council and special assistant to Pakistan’s prime minister on crypto and blockchain, met with El Salvador Nayib Bukele. They signed a Letter of Intent to share know‑how on public‑sector Bitcoin use, blockchain‑driven financial inclusion and policy design for markets still finding their footing. Pakistan Signs Framework With El Salvador According to reports, the agreement establishes a formal connection between El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office and the Pakistan Crypto Council. Its objective is to advise Islamabad while it formalizes regulations regarding the adoption of cryptocurrency. Pakistan is already subject to a $7 billion IMF loan program to 2027. Now it wishes to learn from the mistakes Bukele made when he legalized crypto as legal tender in September 2021, while facing opposition from the International Monetary Fund regarding fiscal risks. Just met one of the most extraordinary visionary leaders of our time, President of El Salvador, @nayibbukele A head of state who doesn’t just talk tech, but challenges it, from AI and robotics to Bitcoin. He’s a leader from the future, who saw the future first because when it… pic.twitter.com/QpS6vVnTxv — Bilal bin Saqib MBE (@Bilalbinsaqib) July 16, 2025 IMF Concerns Stall Mining Plans According to IMF statements, the fund rejected Pakistan’s bid to offer subsidized power to energy‑intensive industries, including Bitcoin miners. That plan would have tapped up to 2,000 megawatts of seasonal electricity surplus—mainly in winter months—to run mining rigs and AI data centers. The IMF warned that special pricing schemes risked skewing Pakistan’s energy market and undermining fiscal balance. If Islamabad presses ahead without IMF buy‑in, it could trigger fresh delays in loan disbursements. Bitcoin Reserves And Strategic Talks Pakistan’s delegation also held a virtual meeting with Michael Saylor, whose firm Strategy holds more than $62 billion in crypto reserves. Saylor shared insights on managing a large‑scale BTC portfolio and using digital assets as an institutional treasury tool. Pakistan hopes to learn how to build its own “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” without exposing public finances to wild price swings. El Salvador now holds over 6,240 BTC, valued at about $740 million, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. Bukele’s team has bought more than 3,000 BTC since rolling out its Bitcoin Law, even as critics pointed to market volatility and operational hurdles. Next Steps For Islamabad Saqib hailed Bukele as “one of the most extraordinary visionary leaders of our time,” noting that conviction mattered more than deep pockets when staking a country’s reputation on digital currency. Based on reports, Pakistan plans to dispatch technical teams to El Salvador later this year. They will study Bukele’s tax framework for Bitcoin gains, the setup of the country’s Bitcoin trust and pilot projects that tap blockchain for government payments.

        "SOURCE_ID": 67,
        "BODY": "Kaspa (KAS): The Standard for Speed Kaspa (KAS) , currently trading around $0.09351, has rightfully earned its reputation for incredible transactional throughput. Its BlockDAG architecture is a significant innovation in the proof-of-work space. The buzz in my channels suggests KAS could see a solid push towards $0.1803 within the next four weeks as network adoption and awareness continue to grow. Kaspa is a purebred racer, built for velocity. Looking across the 2025 horizon, Kaspa is forecast to make substantial gains, potentially reaching $3.53 if it continues its trajectory and the market remains favorable for innovative L1 solutions. Even with a more conservative outlook, KAS holding above $1.85 seems highly plausible. Its transactional prowess is undeniable. But in the evolving Web3 ecosystem, is speed the only metric for a token’s ultimate value and utility within a dedicated platform? Source: Coinmarketcap – KASPA Utility-Focused Crypto—The May 2025 Investor’s Edge The May 2025 crypto investor isn’t just looking at transactions per second. We’ve matured. We understand that while transactional prowess, like Kaspa’s, is vital for a base layer, true, sustainable platform value is driven by a token with deep, multifaceted utility. A token that isn’t just fast but is also essential for participation, governance, rewards, and growth within its specific ecosystem. OpenFundNet’s OFNT token has been engineered with this philosophy at its core. It’s not just about speed; it’s about building an entire economic engine. Here are four key features that demonstrate OFNT offers a different, arguably richer, spectrum of utility than just pure transactional speed: 1. Fueling the Core Engine: Beyond Transactions to Active Project Funding & Validation. Kaspa’s KAS token is primarily the fuel for its high-speed network, facilitating rapid transactions. This is crucial. However, the OpenFundNet (OFNT) token takes utility a giant leap further by being the indispensable cog in its entire crowdfunding lifecycle. Direct Project Funding: OFNT is designed to be the primary currency for backers to fund innovative projects launched on the platform. This creates intrinsic demand directly tied to platform activity and success. Validator Staking & Trust Building: To become a validator—an expert responsible for meticulously reviewing and scoring projects to ensure quality and viability—individuals must stake a significant amount of OFNT. This isn’t just passive staking for network security like on many L1s; it’s an active role where staked OFNT underpins the platform’s core trust mechanism. Validators have skin in the game, ensuring diligent curation. This direct integration into the funding and validation processes means OFNT’s utility is not just about network operation but about enabling and securing the very purpose of the OpenFundNet platform—a depth of utility that transactional prowess alone doesn’t encompass. 2. Powering a Hyper-Engaged Ecosystem with Massive, Smartly-Split Daily Rewards. A thriving ecosystem needs active participation. OpenFundNet (OFNT) supercharges this with a powerful daily emission system, a feature designed to create a vibrant and deeply engaged community from day one. Get this: 2.7 million OFNT tokens are minted and distributed daily. This isn’t just an arbitrary inflation number; it’s a strategic injection of rewards, split intelligently: 50% to Project Backers: Rewarding those who identify and fund promising projects. 50% to Active Validators: Compensating them for their crucial due diligence work. This creates a dynamic where every core participant is continuously incentivized. While Kaspa’s mining rewards secure its network, OFNT’s emissions directly fuel the platform’s unique crowdfunding loop, fostering a level of user engagement and ecosystem activity that is purpose-built and constantly reinforced. 3. Engineered for Long-Term Value & Scarcity: Deflationary Halvings & Real Governance. Kaspa has its own emission schedule designed for its PoW consensus. OpenFundNet, however, introduces a powerful combination for OFNT focused on long-term value accrual and community empowerment: Deflationary Supply via 2-Year Halvings: The 2.7 million daily OFNT emissions aren’t indefinite at that rate. OpenFundNet incorporates a halving mechanism, set for approximately 2-year cycles. This means the rate of new OFNT creation will systematically decrease over time, introducing increasing scarcity—a proven model for long-term value retention, especially as platform demand grows. Genuine Governance Power for Holders: OFNT isn’t just a utility token; it’s a governance token. Holders will have the power to vote on critical platform decisions, including protocol upgrades, fee structures (if any are introduced for new services beyond the core no-fee crowdfunding), and the allocation of community treasury funds. This gives the community a real stake in the platform’s evolution. This dual approach of programmed scarcity through halvings and decentralized governance ensures that OFNT is designed not just for current utility but as a valuable, appreciating asset that aligns with the long-term success of a community-directed platform. 4. Unmatched Multi-Role Utility & Exclusive Early Access Perks—A Token for Every Participant. The OFNT token is designed with multi-role utility at its core, making it indispensable for all key participants within the OpenFundNet ecosystem: Creators will eventually receive funding in OFNT and interact with the token economy. Backers: Use OFNT to fund projects and earn OFNT rewards. Validators: Stake OFNT to perform due diligence and earn OFNT rewards. Nominators: Stake OFNT behind trusted validators to also earn rewards. This cross-platform relevance ensures widespread use and demand. Furthermore, for those of us who understand the power of early entry, the OpenFundNet presale offers significant benefits for early holders. These typically include preferential token pricing, bonus token allocations, and potentially early access to staking and validator roles. This provides an unparalleled opportunity to not only acquire OFNT at its foundational stage but also to become an integral, rewarded part of the ecosystem from its inception—an advantage that goes far beyond simply holding a fast L1 token acquired on the open market. More Than Speed: OFNT Is Building a Value-Driven Ecosystem To be clear, Kaspa’s transactional prowess is a phenomenal achievement in the Layer 1 space. But in May 2025, the projects poised for truly disruptive, long-term success are those whose tokens offer a rich tapestry of utility, deeply embedded into every function of their ecosystem. OpenFundNet’s OFNT token is precisely this: an engine for funding, a reward for participation, a tool for governance, and an asset designed for sustainable value. Its features are not just bullet points on a whitepaper; they are the interlocking gears of a platform set to revolutionize decentralized crowdfunding.

        "BODY": "Lido DAO (LDO) price rose more than 11% in a short period of time, temporarily reaching $1.03. This sudden increase is thought to be due to BlackRock's application to add a staking feature to its Ethereum ETF. Chart showing the rise in LDO price following the news. Lido DAO operates as a liquid staking derivative provider for Ethereum. Users lock up their ETH with Lido DAO, assuming a certain amount of additional risk, and in return receive a token called stETH, considered equivalent to ETH. This allows users to both lock up their tokens and still have liquid use of their ETH on additional decentralized finance platforms. Related News: JUST IN: White House Makes Surprise Statements About Cryptocurrencies - “Open Support for Legal Regulations” BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, plans to add staking capabilities to its iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) fund, which offers investments in Ethereum. The fund's Nasdaq exchange filed an updated 19b-4 filing with the SEC today, incorporating this change. This application indicates that BlackRock is not only looking to gain exposure to ETH price movements, but also to directly participate in Ethereum's proof-of-stake consensus system. If approved, a portion of the fund's Ethereum holdings could be used to generate returns by staking through trusted third-party providers. *This is not investment advice.

Daily transactions jump above 10,000, confirming growing network activity alongside rising price momentum. Over 50 million CRV withdrawn from exchanges, signaling potential long-term accumulation. CRV Breaks Past Key Price Zone Curve DAO’s CRV token jumped more than 22% over the past day, trading at $0.96. The move adds to its 7-day rally of over 70%, placing it among this week’s top performers. Volume also surged, with over $833 million in daily trades. Looking at the chart, there is a clean breakout from a downward channel that had been in place since early May. CRV also cleared a horizontal resistance area between $0.80 and $0.85. According to market analyst Alpha Crypto Signal, “As long as CRV holds above the previous resistance, the momentum remains with the bulls.” #CRV HTF Analysis: $CRV has broken out of a descending channel and cleared the horizontal resistance zone. $CRV exploded with strong volume, confirming a bullish breakout. Now, a retest of the breakout zone would offer a solid long opportunity. As long as $CRV holds above the… pic.twitter.com/0IW43tE57U — Alpha Crypto Signal (@alphacryptosign) July 17, 2025 Technical Signals Still Point Up The token trades well above its 9-day EMA at $0.74 and its 50-day SMA at $0.6116. Both moving averages are rising, showing firm upside momentum. The breakout candle closed above resistance, a move often viewed as a sign of buying strength. Notably, the next area to watch is a possible retest near $0.85. If the price holds there, buyers may aim for a push toward $1.05. Resistance sits around $0.995, while support lies at $0.775 and $0.56 based on recent trading ranges. Transaction Count Rises with Price Curve’s on-chain activity has picked up. Daily transaction count recently rose above 10,000, a level not seen in months. This uptick in usage matches CRV’s sharp price increase, reflecting stronger network participation. Source: CryptoQuant Data from early July shows consistent growth in network activity. If this trend holds, it could help support CRV’s current valuation and any further moves up. Exchange Outflows Suggest Accumulation More than 50 million CRV tokens have been moved off exchanges in recent days, based on CryptoQuant figures. That’s the largest outflow recorded this year. Overall, CRV has seen steady withdrawals since January. Source: CryptoQuant Historically, large inflows have been followed by price drops, while outflows have come ahead of rallies. With tokens leaving exchanges and prices rising, some traders believe long-term holders are positioning ahead of potential continuation.

        "BODY": "According to a recent security report, officials in China are using malware called Massistant to mine data from seized smartphones. Security research firm Lookout stated that the Chinese police could seize any phone or computer without a warrant and gain access to personal data immediately. Massistant mines SMS messages, images, audio files, videos, and even GPS location data. The malware is developed by Xiamen Meiya Pico, a Chinese tech company specializing in commercial surveillance software and equipment. The company controls 40% of the digital forensics market in China. Massistant is broadly used by the Chinese police Chinese citizens have reported multiple times on local forums about finding malware on their phones after interacting with the police. One of the posts dates back to 2020, indicating that the malware has been widely used by the Chinese police in the past five years. In the post, the user asked if the police had installed malware in his phone. Another user named topsky replied and said, “It is likely that your information was collected when you were given an administrative penalty for illegal behavior, including your mobile phone.” The malware poses a major threat to travelers to and within mainland China. Tourists, businessmen, and employees from multinational companies could face an order to hand in their smartphones to the Chinese authorities. Sensitive data could leak easily since the police need no warrant to seize these devices. Lookout stated that the malware works only on unlocked devices. The security firm shared a photo showing multiple smartphones connected to a hardware tower. The hardware is then connected to an external laptop or computer. The security firm stated that Massistant is an Android application; however, the firm could not find an equivalent version for iOS users. The illustrations obtained from Xiamen Meiya Pico show multiple iPhones connected to the hardware tower, suggesting the existence of an iOS version. Source: Xiamen Meiya Pico. Massistant leaves a footprint on any phone or device, making it easy to delete permanently. However, once the malware is installed, it steals data, making the damage irreversible. Lookout stated that Massistant is the successor to another tool named MSSocket, which was created by Xiamen Meiya Pico. Security researchers analyzed and exposed the threats of MSSocket in 2019. In 2021, Xiamen Meiya Pico was sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). According to the designation, the Chinese company poses a significant threat to U.S. national security due to its role in developing and distributing surveillance technologies. OFAC alleges that Xiamen Meiya Pico facilitates human rights abuses and supports authoritarian surveillance efforts. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

        "BODY": "Why Crypto Baskets Are Back in the Spotlight in 2025 The crypto market in 2025 feels very different from just a couple of years ago. After a rollercoaster of highs and lows, investors are looking for something that feels less like gambling and more like structured investing. That’s where crypto baskets come in — curated collections of different cryptocurrencies grouped together to reduce risk and maximize potential growth. Interestingly, even companies outside the traditional finance world are watching this trend. The official Soft2Bet LinkedIn profile recently shared insights about how the gaming and entertainment industry is paying attention to blockchain-based assets. While Soft2Bet is mainly known for online entertainment and fintech solutions, its interest in digital asset infrastructure highlights how mainstream this topic has become. The Benefits of Crypto Baskets for Retail Investors Crypto baskets are designed for those who don’t want to spend hours researching every single token. Instead of betting on one “moonshot” coin, you spread your investment across multiple digital assets, often managed by platforms that rebalance the portfolio automatically. Key reasons people love crypto baskets in 2025: Diversification made simple – Spreading funds across different assets lowers the risk of total loss if one project fails. Less emotional trading – Automated allocation helps avoid panic-selling during market dips. Exposure to emerging tokens – Many baskets include smaller altcoins that could become the next big thing. Time-saving – You don’t need to constantly follow charts or news; professionals or algorithms do it for you. But Are They Safe? The Hidden Risks Of course, not everything is perfect. Crypto baskets can still be volatile because they rely on the same market dynamics as individual coins. Some platforms charge high management fees, and you’re trusting someone else’s judgment about which tokens deserve to be in the basket. Another risk is overconfidence. Because baskets feel “safer,” many investors put in more money than they would otherwise, forgetting that a basket full of high-risk coins is still high risk. Soft2Bet, Fintech, and the Bigger Picture The fact that a company like Soft2Bet even mentions blockchain asset strategies shows how fintech and entertainment businesses are merging with crypto culture. The crossover is interesting: businesses that deal with high user traffic and fast payment systems are naturally curious about tokenized economies. It doesn’t mean Soft2Bet is launching a crypto basket tomorrow, but their acknowledgment hints at a world where entertainment platforms might offer integrated digital asset options in the future. That might help crypto baskets become more popular. Should you buy crypto baskets in 2025? If you’re expecting overnight millionaire success, crypto baskets aren’t magic. But if your goal is gradual exposure to crypto with lower stress, they can be a smart way to participate in the digital economy. The smartest approach? Like with any other high-risk investment, always spend money you can afford to lose, pick trustworthy platforms, and constantly study the coins in the basket. In the end Crypto baskets in 2025 aren’t just for crypto enthusiasts anymore — they’re becoming a gateway for mainstream investors curious about blockchain without diving too deep into technical analysis. And with major players like Soft2Bet discussing blockchain infrastructure publicly, the line between entertainment, fintech, and investing keeps getting thinner. If you’re ready to step into crypto but want to avoid constant chart-watching, a crypto basket might be your best first move this year.

        "BODY": "A multi-billion-dollar bank is planning to shell out $510,000 to settle a class action lawsuit stemming from allegations that the financial institution hit customers with improper overdraft fees. Customers accuse Park National Bank of assessing allegedly improper Authorized Positive Purportedly Settled Negative (APPSN) fees between November 1st, 2016 and February 20th, 2025. An account that is initially authorized for a transaction but later has insufficient funds to process it and is overdrawn will receive APPSN fees, according to Law Insider . The Ohio-based Park National Bank, which U.S. Federal Reserve statistics indicate has more than $9.8 billion in consolidated assets, denies any wrongdoing or liability but opted to settle the case to avoid dealing with the cost of litigation. The bank agreed to create a settlement fund of $510,000, and it will also provide overdraft forgiveness as defined in the agreement. Of that settlement fund, up to $170,000 could go toward attorneys’ fees. The court will determine the amount of the attorneys’ fees and costs based on numerous factors, including risk, time and the outcome of the case. The court plans to hold a final approval hearing for the settlement on September 5th. If it is approved, payments should be made within two months of the effective date.

        "BODY": "Blockchain data research firm Chainalysis says that North Korean hackers are on track to make 2025 the biggest year in crypto theft history. In its 2025 Crypto Crime Mid-Year Update, Chainalysis says 2025’s losses have already surpassed the total losses from 2024. “With over $2.17 billion stolen from cryptocurrency services so far in 2025, this year is more devastating than the entirety of 2024. The DPRK’s (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea [North Korea]) $1.5 billion hack of ByBit, the largest single hack in crypto history, accounts for the majority of service losses.” Source: Chainalysis Currently, hackers have stolen 17% more than they had by this time in 2022, the worst year on record. If the scams stay on pace, crypto could see over $4 billion stolen by year’s end. While the ByBit breach set the record for the biggest heist ever, Chainalysis finds that more and more attacks are coming against individual user wallets. “Personal wallet compromises now represent a growing share of total ecosystem theft, with attackers increasingly targeting individual users, making up 23.35% of all stolen fund activity year-to-date in 2025.” Source: Chainalysis Even more telling — while previous crypto thefts have mostly occurred in the digital realm, more and more threats are turning to physical violence. “‘Wrench attacks’ — physical violence or coercion against crypto holders — show correlation with bitcoin price movements, suggesting opportunistic targeting during high-value periods.” Source: Chainalysis Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "BODY": "The bond market in Japan is cracking under pressure, and all fingers are pointing to one thing: the upcoming Upper House election on July 20. What should be just another political shuffle is now looking like a trigger for a financial shake-up, both inside the country and far beyond. With government bond yields already hovering near record levels, investors are bracing for more volatility, especially if fiscal policy turns looser and debt starts ballooning again. It’s not just about numbers anymore. This election could change Japan’s entire economic direction. Voters are being offered promises of cash handouts and cuts to the consumption tax, which may look good on paper but spell trouble for bond markets already dealing with rising inflation and interest rate uncertainty. Bond vigilantes circle Japan’s debt like sharks The phrase “bond vigilantes” is being whispered in financial circles again, and Japan may be their next big play. These are fixed-income investors who bail on buying government debt when they think the risk isn’t worth the return. The idea of them targeting Japan used to be absurd. After all, the Bank of Japan owns over half the national debt, and it kept tight control of the yield curve for years. But that was the old Japan. Now inflation is rising , debt is mounting, and policy is shifting. Ed Yardeni, the veteran investor who coined the term “bond vigilantes” back in the 1980s, believes we’re heading right back into that territory. In a note from Yardeni Research, the firm warned about “the high odds that the next Japanese government turns to tax cuts and increased spending in ways that trigger the Bond Vigilantes.” And once they’re spooked, the whole global bond market could feel the ripple. Japanese long-term bond yields at the 30- and 40-year marks have already jumped nearly one full percentage point over the past year. If things keep trending like this, that jump will look small in hindsight. And the kicker? This election is also being seen as a referendum on Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s coalition. If his grip weakens, expect the debt trajectory to tilt even more aggressively. Chief economist Joseph Brusuelas from RSM said , “It’s a preview of coming attractions as the U.S. has to address competing demands for scarce federal dollars which typically result in increased government spending, higher interest rates, higher yields and higher inflation.” In other words, Japan might just be showing the world what’s next. Credit downgrade fears grow with promises of tax cuts Here’s the real fear: Japan’s credit rating might be headed for a downgrade. That’s not just speculation—it’s showing up in the numbers. Bloomberg data shows interest payments as a percentage of revenue are climbing fast. This year, that figure is expected to hit 12.2%, up from 9.9% just one year ago. If that trajectory holds, it’ll hit an eight-year high by March 2026. The last time this ratio topped 13%, back in 2015, S&P Global Ratings downgraded Japan’s credit to A+. The difference is, back then, there was no panic. The BOJ was running a massive stimulus program and buying bonds like candy. That’s no longer the case. Inflation is up. The central bank is trying to pull back. And that means the safety net is gone. A downgrade today wouldn’t just hit Japan. It would trigger global effects because Japanese investors are the largest foreign holders of U.S. Treasury bonds. And with the BOJ no longer suppressing long-term yields like it used to, any instability in JGBs (Japanese government bonds) flows straight into global markets. Bloomberg’s analysis of the 10- to 30-year spread confirms that those bonds have become far more reactive to even minor shocks. Bo Zhuang, a strategist with Loomis Sayles Investments Asia, warned, “If the Liberal Democratic Party were to lose its majority in the upcoming Upper House election, it might force it to accept a broader consumption tax cut, which would be a major blow.” Zhuang also said foreign investors would likely reduce exposure to Japanese government bonds if debt sustainability becomes a front-page issue again. And at this point, with campaign promises centered around tax cuts and handouts, that’s no longer a hypothetical. It’s what the market is pricing in.

        "BODY": "After reaching a record high of $123,200, Bitcoin is now consolidating around the $118,000 level. Market participants remain on alert as top analyst Darkfost reported a major development involving one of the oldest and most closely watched wallets in crypto history. According to the analyst, the remaining 40,000 BTC—valued at approximately $4.75 billion—still held by the 80K Satoshi-era whale have all moved. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rebounds – $0–$10K Transfer Volume Turns Positive The shift began last night, signaling renewed activity from the early Bitcoin holder. Until now, only half of the whale’s holdings had been moved, while the rest remained dormant. This latest transfer marks the full mobilization of the entire 80,000 BTC once controlled by the entity. While the motive behind the move remains unknown, the market is watching closely for signs of potential selling or redistribution. Bitcoin’s ability to hold above key support levels despite this high-stakes movement may reflect strong demand and investor confidence. However, with $4.75 billion now in motion, traders are bracing for possible volatility ahead. The market is waiting to see if this event will trigger broader implications—or if it’s simply a strategic reshuffling from one of the ecosystem’s earliest whales. Satoshi-Era BTC Consolidates Into Single Address Darkfost highlighted a major on-chain development that has captured the market’s attention: Each of the four wallets, previously holding 10,000 BTC from the 80K whale, sent their funds to a single destination address bc1qs4nzm0je7wqfyfmqr4ht4upyzy57vc95nf4au0. This address now holds the entire $4.75 billion stash, raising new questions about the intent behind the move. According to Darkfost, while the pattern differs from previous sell-off precedents, the market must remain alert. “I guess these BTC might also end up hitting the market soon,” he commented. This kind of movement—especially from dormant, high-value wallets—often signals large-scale positioning, which can precede either institutional sales or strategic long-term storage. The timing coincides with rising bullish momentum across the crypto market. With Bitcoin consolidating above $118,000 following its $123,200 all-time high, traders are eyeing a potential breakout. Adding fuel to this outlook, all three key crypto-related bills were passed by the US House this week, removing significant regulatory uncertainty and clearing a path for broader adoption.

This breakout follows a prolonged consolidation just below the $110,000 resistance, which acted as a ceiling for several months. Now turned support, the $109,300 and $103,600 zones are critical demand levels, offering a firm foundation for continuation if bulls maintain control. The structure of the recent weekly candles reflects bullish dominance, characterized by strong bodies and relatively small upper wicks. This suggests controlled profit-taking and growing confidence from buyers. Meanwhile, volume is picking up, confirming participation in the breakout and hinting at the possibility of sustained momentum in the coming weeks.

As Bitcoin consolidates above former resistance, this zone may now serve as a launchpad for a move toward the next psychological target at $130,000.

        "BODY": "In a rapidly growing crypto market, Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to face headwinds, with its price momentum stalling amid growing uncertainty. But while SHIB grapples with resistance, a new coin is seizing the spotlight, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Phase 5 Mutuum Finance presale recently crossed 80% sold out at $0.03. This is as cheap as the token gets, with later phases guaranteeing a hike in price. Presale has garnered more than $12.5 million and opened up to more than 13500 unique holders. As meme coins lose steam, market sentiment appears to be pivoting toward utility-driven tokens like Mutuum Finance a signal of shifting investor priorities in the DeFi space. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Rangebound Movement Signals Market Caution Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading around $0.0000137, showing minimal momentum as technical indicators suggest a consolidation phase. Analysts forecast SHIB to remain rangebound between $0.0000129 and $0.0000141 in the short term, with a potential breakout above $0.0000145 only if broader market sentiment improves. Despite whale accumulation and moderate on-chain activity, SHIB lacks a clear bullish catalyst, and any significant price movement may hinge on Bitcoin’s trajectory. With SHIB struggling to recover its previous highs, market participants are increasingly redirecting their focus toward emerging tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Presale Phase 5 Nears Sellout Amid Rising Demand Mutuum Finance is gaining traction in Phase 5 of the presale. The project stands out from other projects in that it has real use cases and does not rely on hype. Investor interest is growing with the project having already passed more than $12.5 million and having over 13500 token holders. Mutuum Finance Set to Launch USD-Pegged Stablecoin Mutuum Finance is building a fully-collateralized USD-stabilized stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The project was also audited by CertiK, the most secure blockchain security firm. Besides providing reassurance to the investors regarding the code base integrity and transparency, the audit conducted indicates that the project is confident to establish a secure DeFi protocol. For the promise to be made a reality, the project has arrived with a 50,000 Bug Bounty Program in association with CertiK. The four categories of vulnerabilities are specifically categorized as critical, major, minor and low. Strengthening the Ecosystem Through Community Growth and Rewards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is awarding a $100,000 giveaway , as a token of appreciation to early supporters and in remembrance of presale frenzy. Ten winners will receive a $10,000 award in MUTM tokens as a token of appreciation for being among the early adopters of the project. As more and more communities are growing at an accelerating rate, the early adopters are rewarded not only with the potential future benefits but also with real rewards. With its unique leaderboard system the first 50 holders of Mutuum Finance will be rewarded with bonus tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a serious contender in the DeFi space, offering more than just speculation. With over $12.5 million raised, 13,500+ holders, a soon-to-launch USD-pegged stablecoin, and backing from a CertiK audit and bug bounty, the project is laying a robust foundation for long-term growth. As Shiba Inu struggles for direction, investor attention is rapidly tilting toward high-utility tokens like MUTM. Time is running out on Phase 5 of the presale, lock in your position now and be part of a DeFi protocol that’s built to scale.

        "BODY": "A White House spokesperson announced that President Donald Trump has openly supported new legislation aimed at encouraging the use of cryptocurrencies. The spokesperson stated that they want to make payments with cryptocurrency easier and more widespread in daily life, saying, “We want to make transactions as simple as buying coffee with cryptocurrency possible.” The White House specifically said it supports a tax exemption of up to $600 on cryptocurrency spending. The spokesperson said the measure was supported by President Trump and is part of his goal to “make crypto payments more efficient.” Related News: Ripple Founder Makes Controversial Coin Transfer as XRP Price Nears All-Time High The spokesperson stated that the “GENIUS Act,” which includes regulations on cryptocurrency taxation and digital payments, has sufficient support for passage in Congress, and announced that President Trump is scheduled to sign the legislation on Friday. He is also expected to sign other legislation related to encryption technologies at the event. In statements made by the White House, it was stated that the ongoing trade negotiations with the European Union were progressing in a “promising” manner, while the assessment was made that “We will wait and see” regarding the planned agreement with Canada. The spokesman said that if Russia does not reach an agreement within 50 days, it will face high customs duties and secondary sanctions will be imposed on those purchasing Russian oil in the process. *This is not investment advice.

On the one-hour price chart, the asset has seen a strong trending phase, pushing from under $0.0000950 straight through $0.0001340 in a nearly vertical manner. Even more interesting, volume came alive right as the price exploded. That’s not just momentum—that’s conviction Following this steep rise, $FLOKI has begun consolidating within a well‑defined bullish flag pattern. Two downward‑sloping parallel trendlines contain the pullback, with the lower boundary around $0.0001250 and the upper boundary near $0.0001350. This consolidation has been unfolding on declining volume, a textbook sign that selling pressure is more about cooling momentum than initiating a reversal. Price is now pressing back toward the upper boundary of the flag, suggesting mounting pressure for another breakout attempt. The volume footprint on the four‑hour chart adds depth to this view. A substantial delta of 10.34 billion in buying against 96.89 billion in selling shows that despite the massive turnover, buyers have consistently absorbed offers and driven $FLOKI higher during key pushes. There are also massive positive spikes, such as a 1.12 billion delta on strong volume, indicating aggressive entry by bulls. Some red delta bars appear within the flag, reflecting profit taking or short-term resistance, but they remain relatively contained compared to the bullish footprints. This mix of strong buyer dominance punctuated by lighter sell bursts aligns with the idea of a resting market that has yet to give up ground. The derivative data provides additional confirmation of the sustained upward momentum. Open interest grew by over 58% to $84.75 million alongside a 517% increase in trading volume, showing fresh capital flowing into positions. The long/short ratios are roughly balanced near 0.94–0.95 across major venues, which suggests that despite the bullish move, positioning is not excessively crowded on one side. The liquidation data shows that the market is still playing favorites with the bulls. In the last 24 hours, short sellers were squeezed harder, with $550,000 liquidated versus $518,000 on longs. It’s not a huge gap, but it’s telling. What we’re seeing now is textbook consolidation after that explosive breakout. If price breaks through the upper flag boundary near $0.0001350 with renewed buy‑side deltas and continued derivative expansion, the next measured move could carry toward $0.0001450 and beyond. However, a failure to hold $0.0001250 support within the flag would turn focus toward a breakdown and potential retracement back to the $0.0001180 accumulation zone.

        "BODY": "The popular XRP-themed account “$589” posted an extensive update outlining the current status and implications of the Digital Asset Market Structure Clarity Act (H.R. 3633), commonly referred to as the CLARITY Act. According to the post , if the U.S. House of Representatives enacts the bipartisan legislation, it could officially classify XRP as a commodity , potentially ending regulatory uncertainty surrounding the asset. Provisions of the CLARITY Act The tweet provided details on what the legislation contains and why it is significant for digital assets. The CLARITY Act, formally named the Digital Asset Market Structure Clarity Act, aims to define the circumstances under which a digital asset is considered a commodity. It also seeks to limit what the account described as regulatory overreach by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, instead assigning primary oversight of digital assets to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The post emphasized that this proposed law aligns with Judge Analisa Torres’ prior ruling in the Ripple case, which determined that XRP was not a security when sold on secondary markets. However, as “$589” noted, the new bill would elevate that principle from case law to federal legislation, providing a statutory framework rather than a judicial interpretation. Implications for Ripple and XRP According to the tweet, Ripple has been advocating for such regulatory clarity since 2013. The account suggested that Ripple’s business model, particularly its cross-border payments network and enterprise-grade liquidity solutions, requires a clear legal status for XRP. The tweet mentioned Ripple’s products RippleNet and RLUSD, clarifying that stablecoins like RLUSD do not replace XRP but instead complement it. It explained that while stablecoins function as local vehicles, XRP remains the global bridge asset for transactions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The tweet further argued that the passage of this legislation could open the door for broader institutional adoption of XRP by removing the legal uncertainties that have deterred banks, payment companies, and other institutional players. It also stated that clear regulatory guardrails would reduce risk, potentially paving the way for new financial products such as exchange-traded funds based on XRP. Market Response and Outlook The account also commented on recent market behavior, noting that options data indicate XRP volatility has increased by nearly 100 percent, with expectations of price swings exceeding 13 percent in the near term. The post interpreted this as a sign that institutional investors are already positioning themselves in anticipation of the vote. The tweet framed the upcoming House vote as a historic moment for the U.S. digital asset market, with XRP positioned “front and center.” The account underscored that passage of the CLARITY Act in the House would leave only Senate approval before it could become law, describing it as potentially the most significant regulatory shift in U.S. crypto history. According to “$589,” XRP remains the bridge asset for the emerging financial system, and this vote marks a decisive step toward that vision.

        "BODY": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Bank of Thailand (BOT) have come up with a strategic program, “crypto sandbox,” making it much easier for foreign tourists to stay in Thailand. With the program, they can change their digital assets to Thailand’s baht currency . This project comes when Thailand aims to attract more tourists to increase revenue, contributing to the nation’s economic growth. Initially piloted in Phuket, the initiative now expands nationwide after receiving positive feedback and strong adoption. Thailand hopes the sandbox will boost tourism revenue and cement its role as a regional fintech leader by embracing crypto-friendly policies. Thailand embraces the crypto sandbox project under stricter regulatory measures The crypto sandbox project has greatly supported the crypto ecosystem. For instance, tourists possessing cryptocurrency like Bitcoin do not have to worry about how they will survive in Thailand. This is because the project permits them to freely access digital asset trading platforms like crypto exchanges, cryptocurrency middlemen, and dealers to convert their cryptocurrencies to the baht. Afterwards, the tourists can pay for goods and services using the QR codes obtained when they use Thailand’s currency on online payment platforms and digital wallets. Notably, based on the country’s regulations, one cannot directly make payments using cryptocurrencies. Therefore, as the project promotes financial technology, it provides a safer way to convert cryptocurrencies into regular money for use under the strict regulations set. The crypto sandbox project also includes protective measures to address economic challenges and ensure tourists use their funds responsibly. To achieve this, the project has outlined well-defined limits on how things will be operated in this sector. According to rules released in Thailand, all service issuers should obtain a license permitting them to carry out their operations and strictly adhere to the country’s know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. In addition, the sandbox has set aside rules that require foreign tourists in the country to undergo identity confirmation processes before taking the initiative to change their digital assets to Thailand’s currency. Similarly, the SEC has also applied spending measures to foreign tourists. Based on this regulation, the regulators will monitor and manage their transactions. For example, the tourists will only be allowed to consume a maximum of ฿50,000, worth nearly USD 1,375 monthly. This spending limitation will apply to local shops like food stalls and markets. On the other hand, for certified businesses like hotels and expensive restaurants, tourists’ monthly consumption limitation is raised to ฿500,000, which is approximately USD 13,750. Since this project is being exercised for the first time, it will effectively last 18 months. This may, however, be extended after regulators examine its performance, public reaction, and safety reports. Thailand’s sandbox project faces criticism from individuals Concerning the sandbox project, the SEC and BOT have opened room for public feedback with a deadline of August 13 this year. The regulators have also called on the individuals involved in the industry, banks, and companies in tourism to weigh in on the situation. This initiative aims to solidify the country’s position as the leader in the fintech space and make Thailand a region of new ideas. With safeguarding measures and regulations in place, it is anticipated that this will create a conducive environment for crypto and traditional money to cooperate and attract proprietors of digital assets worldwide. In the meantime, the project has faced criticism from several Phuket tourism sectors. Based on their argument, there is a shortage of education and communication on the project. This was not all, questions have been raised concerning which cryptocurrencies will be applied in this project, and the risk of abuse in the situation when monitoring systems are not strong enough. Despite all this, the project is still viewed as a game-changer for the tourism sector. If successfully adopted, other countries will be eager to apply it in their tourism sector, becoming a global FinTech trend.

        "BODY": "TL;DR Ripple’s native token continues its gradual ascent toward the January 2018 all-time high of $3.4 and surged past $3.3 minutes ago. The volatile rally has left certain over-leveraged traders in limbo, as the liquidations for XRP alone are well above $40 million on a daily scale. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView As the immortal Metallica song goes – ‘So close, no matter how far.’ XRP is just in reach of a new all-time high, more than seven years after it set a record at $3.4. The asset has jumped by roughly 50% since last week when it broke out of its consolidation phase, and has skyrocketed by 75% since the late June low of $1.9. CryptoPotato asked ChatGPT about the cryptocurrency’s chances to go into uncharted territory in July since it failed to do so in January this year when it matched the 2018 record. The AI chatbot outlined why the $3.4 resistance could be harder to penetrate than most people expect, but also laid out several bullish factors that could propel another rally. Since then, XRP has increased by a few more cents and jumped to a new six-month peak of $3.34 (on Bitstamp) minutes ago. Thus, it was less than 2% away from a new all-time high. Although it has retraced slightly since then, it’s still above $3.3 as of press time. Its volatile ride has liquidated thousands of speculative traders with both shorts and longs. However, short positions dominate, with over $29 million such liquidations out of the total $44.32 million. Liquidation Heat Map. Source: CoinGlass XRP still trails BTC and especially ETH in terms of daily liquidations, as the second-largest cryptocurrency flew to a multi-month high of its own at almost $3,500.

        "BODY": "Ripple co-founder and chairman Chris Larsen may be preparing to sell again as the XRP price approaches a new all-time high. Larsen sent approximately $26 million worth of XRP to Coinbase earlier this week, according to on-chain data. This transfer brings his total XRP sent to the exchange since the beginning of the year to close to $40 million. Transactions from Larsen's public wallet include a transfer of 10 million XRP on January 6 and 1.5 million XRP on June 16. According to XRP Scan data, Larsen also made several transfers to external wallets that facilitate exchanges like Binance. However, it has not yet been confirmed whether these assets were sold. Larsen sent a total of $344 million worth of XRP to exchanges and wallets throughout 2025. XRP is currently trading at $3.26. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Finally Makes Listing Announcement For Anticipated Altcoin Larsen, who founded Ripple in 2013, served as the company's CEO until 2016. He owns approximately 2.6 billion XRP, worth over $8.5 billion at current prices, bringing his net worth to $9.7 billion, according to Forbes. This is more than three times the $3.2 billion estimate last year. Ripple has entered a period of rapid growth after securing significant victories in a lengthy legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In June, the parties mutually withdrew their appeals, officially ending the lawsuit, which began in 2019, with a $50 million settlement. Chris Larsen has been frequently in the news for his XRP sales in the past. The SEC lawsuit alleges that CEO Brad Garlinghouse sold $150 million worth of XRP between 2017 and 2020, while Larsen and his wife sold $450 million worth of XRP during the same period. *This is not investment advice.

        "BODY": "Unlike previous market cycles, where banks have predominantly avoided stablecoins and most other cryptocurrency assets, the sentiment is now towards broader acceptance. As key regulations continue to be reviewed, the adoption landscape is evolving. New Chapters Being Written The news of the plan was shared yesterday by Reuters, with the Bank of America (BOA) joining the ranks of various institutional bodies that have endorsed the stablecoin plan under President Trump’s crypto-friendly legislation. Brian Moynihan, the CEO and President of BOA, noted that “ investors can expect the lender to move forward with it, ” but did not disclose any information as to when this can be expected. Further speaking to analysts during a post-earnings call, the CEO’s approach appears to be cautious and calculated, as they are currently exploring customer demand, which is presently low. The groundwork will likely begin “ at the appropriate time ” and “ in partnership with other players, ” with Moynihan comparing current stablecoin adoption levels of the industry with those of payment platforms like Zelle and Venmo. “ We’ve done a lot of work, ” said Moynihan, hinting that this may have been in development for a while now, but with “ banks still awaiting legal clarity, ” the progress has been slower than some investors would have liked. The wait will likely not be very long, as the trio of anticipated legislation bills —CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC — were advanced to the House floor for debate and consideration after a 9-hour stall of the vote. After speaking with the President late on Wednesday, the House Speaker told reporters: “I’m pleased that we’ll be able to get this done. The president is as well. I just spoke with him, and this is a big priority for him, and it was for us.” A Change of Heart The widespread adoption and ongoing plans for stablecoins by central US banks are in stark contrast to how they were viewed not that long ago. For example, when the BOA’s lead was asked if they planned to incorporate cryptocurrency in their services during a past World Economic Forum, the answer was a straightforward “no.” Previously skeptical as well, the third-largest bank in the United States, Citigroup, is also considering issuing its own stablecoin. Vocal bitcoin critic – JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, announced that the entity will also be entering the space, but without sharing any further details.
